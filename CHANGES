    Escapes \A and \T had unnecessary restrictions regarding the
    allowed character set.  This let to problems when e.g. gen-
    erating man pages with TOC using -dToc.  8-bit characters are
    allowed now.

2016-08-20
    dpost generates valid PostScript when using fonts
    with spaces in the glyph names.
    (Marcin Cie≈õlak (@FreeBSD))

2016-04-27
    -mdoc: Table of contents with hyperlinks and PDF bookmarks
    added.

2016-03-28
    -man: Table of contents with hyperlinks and PDF bookmarks ad-
    ded.

2016-03-15
    eqn bug fixed which had caused crash for DWB neqn test (has
    same code).

2016-03-08
    grap bug fixed which had cause a double free(3) crash.

Release 160308
==============

2016-03-08
    refer:  Bug introduced in commit
    89b1284c1de8071f3d7bb3a308cb080b8e2f311b fixed.  (Reported by
    Anthony J. Bentley (@OpenBSD))

Release 160217
==============

2016-02-17
    tbl:  Invalid memory access bug fixed.  (When testing if a
    line starts with '_' or '=' it did not check if the string is
    empty.)

2016-02-16
    .tr bugfix:  When the first character given to .tr was un-
    known, all character translations had been done wrong.

2016-02-11
    tbl troff bug fixed:  Height of table had been calculated
    wrong.  This could lead to graphics artifacts if a table is
    at page bottom.

2016-02-10
    Many changes to -man and -mdoc.  Heirloom's manual page for-
    matting is now quite compatible to groff.

2016-02-08
    Operator 'v' added for ".if".  (Some manpages using this.)

2016-02-02
    -ms: Macros .QS and .QE added.

2016-01-29
    Support for groff's notation \[uXXXX] added.

2016-01-26
    nroff: Use of new names for .char now possible.  (Up to now
    only names found in the tab file could be used.)

2016-01-01
    Spaces are now allowed in filenames of .cf, .fp, .lf, .nx,
    and .so requests.  The documentation stated that %20 could be
    used to escape spaces.  However this was not implemented.
    The implementation has now been changed to allow spaces by
    quoting the filename with '"'.  Additionally character codes
    up to 255 are allowed now in filenames.  (Bug reported by
    Jacob Parker (https://github.com/jacobp100).)

2015-12-23
    groff's operator ".if F <font>" added.

2015-12-18
    Support for groff's notation \[char<n>] added.

2015-12-10
    File system case-sensitivity issue fixed.  (Reported by Henry
    McGilton.)

2015-10-28
    Set previous font to current font in case of unknown font.
    This is the groff behaviour.  E.g. \fIfoo\fP \f(CWbar\fP blah
    did underline "blah" in AT&T nroff.

2015-09-23
    \n[.ns] implemented (had only been documented up to now).

2015-09-21
    Basic HTML support added.

2015-09-18
    Escape \I added (test if argument is a valid identifier).  \I
    is equivalent to groff's \A.

2015-07-14
    PDFMark: \X'SetBorderStyle' added.

2015-07-08
    Special groff compatibility mode for manual pages added which
    is enabled when register .g is set to 1.

2015-06-24
    .box bug fixed: .box did discard part of roff's state.

2015-06-22
    mm(7): .PGFORM added to allow line length change inside docu-
    ment.

2015-06-10
    .ie-.el bug fixed.  Up to now .ie-.el did not work fully re-
    liable in AT&T roff.  (Found during -mdoc debugging.)

2015-06-08
    mdoc: Macro Lb with library definitions for FreeBSD and
    NetBSD added.

2015-06-05
    nroff -T37 (default), -Tlp and -Tlocale: Display of pic(7)
    drawings implemented.

2015-06-04
    troff -Tpost: All font description files now uppercase (for
    use on case-insensitive file systems) and use of groff font
    names instead of traditional names now possible with .ft and
    \f.

2015-05-26
    Bugfix: nroff: Local motions had not been local (did stay in
    effect across line boundary).

    nroff: Request \D'l ...' added.

2015-05-02
    mdoc(7): .El: List type stack bug fixed.

Release 150406
==============

2015-04-02
    Renamed otfdump(1) into otf_info(1) to avoid conflicts with
    other tools with the same name.

2015-03-27
    man, mdoc:  Special characters for troff updated.

    Bugfix:  pic:  C precedence error found by clang.

2015-03-26
    tbl:  Key letter 'x' added (a GNU tbl extension).

2015-03-22
    mdoc macros updated for troff output.

2015-03-20
    Workaround to handle some .char problems added.  The .char
    implementation needs to be changed eventually.  Currently the
    translation takes place in the input stage but it has to be
    in the output stage.

    man macros (nroff mode):
    - Allow nine instead of six arguments
    - Document formated as one large page
    - mandoc(1) output layout (indent, left adjust, line length
      etc.) adapted
    - Workaround for pod2man(1) bug (causes empty first page) ad-
      ded

    Minor mdoc macro changes (indent and some special charac-
    ters).

2015-03-19
    \\ can now be used in fields and tables to output a \ but it
    is anyway recommended to use \(rs or at least \e instead.
    (Traditionally AT&T roff did reduce \\ to \ in fields and
    tables so \\\\ had been need to be input for printing one \.)

    Bugfix:  roff:  Don't recognize . (dot) as a number.  Now a
    path string like "./." is recognized as "not a number" in-
    stead of "division by zero".

2015-03-18
    Bugfix:  roff:  Prevent NULL pointer access when using .tr
    with characters redefined by .char.

    Bugfix:  tbl:  Prevent uninitialized pointer access.

2015-03-13
    Bugfix:  Using basic control character (normally ".") or no-
    break control charatcer (normally "'") as first argument to
    .char made roff unuseable.

2015-03-02
    tbl:  Option -Tlp configures output of table lines with ASCII
    characters -, =, |, and + (similar to GNU nroff -Tascii).
    Option -Tlocale in a non-UTF-8 locale now behaves as -Tlp.

    Bugfix:  tbl with option -TX:  Double lines had not been
    displayed correctly.

2015-02-27
    tbl:  Option -Tlocale added which (in an UTF-8 locale) en-
    ables output of table lines with Unicode glyphs.

2015-02-26
    Bugfix:  The zero width flag (set e.g. by \z or \L) did not
    work for Unicode characters.  As a consequence e.g. \L could
    not be used width \U'2551' to draw a double vertical line.

2015-02-18
    Bugfix:  When there were several .ft requests to not mounted
    fonts in short succession the output was wrong.

2015-02-12
    Read-only register .S added for DWB compatibility.

2014-12-23
    mdoc:  Footer had not been displayed if page length was
    reached.

Release 141217
==============

2014-12-16
    mdoc updated for processing up-to-date manpages.  Still much
    work needs to be done on mdoc.

    nroff:  Special character names of arbitrary length are now
    possible.

    nroff:  Many special characters to -Tlp and -Tlocale (UTF-8)
    added.

2014-12-15
    nroff: Compiled in "tab.lp" and "tab.utf8" removed.  The
    "nterm" directory is now required for nroff (at least with
    file "tab.lp" or "tab.utf8").

2014-12-13
    Macro 'lsm' and number registers 'lsn' and 'lss' added.

2014-12-05
    Bugfix:  .unformat: \e gets restored now.

2014-11-06
    Distingtion between BSD and non-BSD manuals removed (Anthony
    J. Bentley).

    pic, tbl, eqn: Allow whitespace between '.' and PS, PE, PF,
    TS, TE, EQ, EN.

2014-11-05
    With command line option '-rcR=1' -man manpages are displayed
    as one large single page.

Release 141029
==============

2014-10-29
    Documentation revised by Pierre-Jean Fichet:  doc/fonts/
    changed to use free available OTF fonts.

2014-10-27
    col(1) bugfix:  Avoid to access chars before string.

    troff:  fdprintf changed back to libc fprintf.

    troff:  32 bit bug in register and macro allocation fixed
    (Bug reported by Anthony J. Bentley).

    nroff/troff made -Wall clean.

2014-10-22
    OpenSolaris col(1) added.

2014-10-06
    Drawing of filled polygon (\D'P ...'), filled circle (\D'C
    ...') and filled ellipse (\D'E ...') added.

2014-09-21
    *roff: Option -V for version information added.

2014-09-14
    Any version of roff (e.g. UNIX V7) does count \} as a macro
    argument regarding \n(.$.  This makes \n(.$ rather random if
    you cannot force users to put \} on a separate line *or* to
    put it behind the macro call and substract 1 from \n(.$.  To
    make \n(.$ meaningful again this bug has been fixed now, i.e.
    \} is not considered as a macro argument anymore.

2014-09-07
    Documentation revised by Pierre-Jean Fichet:  doc/just/ and
    doc/quickstart/ changed to use free available OTF fonts.

2014-09-03
    Bug reported by Pierre-Jean Fichet fixed:  If character '"'
    is used in a .char request it did not work in a .if request
    as the string compare delimiter.

2014-08-28
    Bug reported by Blake McBride fixed:  Very old versions of
    the mm macros inserted cut marks in the document for
    typesetters which had used endless paper rolls.  Although
    they are only of historical significance they had never been
    removed in the Solaris version of mm.  They are now switched
    of (via .rm )k).

2014-08-23
    Bugfix by Steffen Nurpmeso:  In .rm code a function return
    value is unchecked used as a pointer.

2014-08-20
    eqn(1) did not compile because of bison to BSD yacc differ-
    ences.  Sorry, had not tested on Linux this time...

2014-08-18
    Experimental bugfix: When .bp is directly followed by .. and
    .bp triggers a macro which calls a macro then document text
    is printed at that trap position.  This bug is also in other
    ditroff derivatives (e.g. DWB and Plan9).  It is difficult to
    track the bug to it's root cause so it is an experimental fix
    at the moment.

2014-08-17
    \fP after \fS did set the font before the previous font and
    not the previous one.

2014-08-16
    Bug reported by Pierre-Jean Fichet fixed:  If character "!"
    is used in a .char request it did not work in a .if request
    as the NOT operator.

2014-08-14
    The eqn parser used type int for all token values--even
    pointers.  This may work fine on 32 bit hardware but causes
    problems on 64 bit.  A new data type had been introduced to
    separate int tokens from pointers.

    Also a bug in the parser regarding movements (e.g. FWD) had
    been fixed.

2014-07-27
    A variable had been initilized after use.  This variable
    minus a literal value is used as an array index.  When data
    from the array is read an invalid memory segment is accessed.
    This had caused crashes on at least OpenBSD.
