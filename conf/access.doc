# This is for folks who are doc committers, but who work on docs in
# the src/ tree as well.
#
# Names must not be here without also being in doc repository access file.
#
# This file does not grant access to the src tree - it only causes
# you to get copies of the src commit email and announcements.
#
# All doc committers implicitly have access to the src tree in order
# to commit to man pages etc.
#
#       KEEP ALPHABETICALLY SORTED!!!
#
# Changes to email forwards can be made without doceng's approval.
# Please use "Approved by: core (implicit), doceng (implicit)" to that
# type of commits.
