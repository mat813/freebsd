Hopefully, this list will one day be obsoleted by DEVFS, but for now
this is the current allocation of device major numbers.

For local use, you are encouraged to use the reserved numbers.

If you intend the driver to be available, send email to the
hackers@freebsd.org mailing list to see about having a number
reserved for you.

The "official" version of this is the one in FreeBSD-current.
See:
 ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/branches/-current/src/sys/conf/majors
 http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/sys/conf/majors

NOTICE: FreeBSD does not use block major numbers anymore, you neither
need to assign nor use a block major number for any device driver any
more.
