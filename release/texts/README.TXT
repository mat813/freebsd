  ERRATA.TXT    Read this file!  It will tell you where to look for the
                latest information on problems which have been found and
                fixed since this release was created (and may bite you).

  README.TXT    This file

  ABOUT.TXT     All about FreeBSD, including contact information

  RELNOTES.TXT  Release Notes - what's new & different in this release

  LAYOUT.TXT    Information about the layout of the release directory.
                If you are installing from floppies, it is especially
                important that you read this section!


  HARDWARE.TXT  Information about the configuration of the GENERIC kernel
                and supported hardware.  New installers should read this
                file.

  UPGRADE.TXT   Upgrading an existing FreeBSD installation

  TROUBLE.TXT   General troubleshooting information


o It is, again, very important to check the ERRATA.TXT file for any
  late-breaking issues with this release.  If you don't read the ERRATA,
  you will probably fall right into the same problems that have already
  been reported (and fixed as noted in the ERRATA).
