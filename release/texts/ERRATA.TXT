If you read no other documentation before installing this
version of FreeBSD, you should at least by all means *READ
THE ERRATA* for this release so that you don't stumble over
problems which have already been found and fixed.  This ERRATA.TXT
file is obviously already out of date by definition, but other
copies are kept updated on the net and should be consulted as
the "current errata" for your release.  These other copies of
the errata are located at: 

  1. http://www.freebsd.org/releases/   

  2. ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/<your-release>/ERRATA.TXT   
     (and any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location).          

Any changes to this file are also automatically emailed to:

	freebsd-stable@freebsd.org

---- Security Advisories:

Current active security advisories for 3.2:

	NOTE to users upgrading from an older version:

	If you are currently running tcpd from /usr/local/libexec, please
	note that the addition of the userland tcpd utilities tcpdmatch
	and tcpdchk into /sbin may result in false rule checking.  These
	utilities are necessary to support the wrapping-capable inetd.
	The new inetd with wrapping expects hosts.allow and hosts.deny to
	reside in /etc, NOT /usr/local/etc (which is where tcpd wants
	them).  

	If you wish to continue to use /usr/local/libexec/tcpd, please
	ensure that you're using the userland tcpd utilities in
	/usr/local/sbin.  If you wish to use the wrapping functionality
	available via inetd -w, please ensure that your hosts.allow and
	hosts.deny files are available in /etc.
