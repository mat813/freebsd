    <title>What's New</title>

    <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
      features in &os; since &release.prev;.</para>

    <para>Typical release note items document recent security
      advisories issued after &release.prev;, new drivers or hardware
      support, new commands or options, major bug fixes, or
      contributed software upgrades.  They may also list changes to
      major ports/packages or release engineering practices.  Clearly
      the release notes cannot list every single change made to &os;
      between releases; this document focuses primarily on security
      advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
      improvements.</para>

    <sect2 id="kernel">
      <title>Kernel Changes</title>

      <para>The &man.closefrom.2; system call has been added.  This
	closes any open file descriptors which are equal to or larger
	than the specified value.  Note that this does not fail with
	any errors and this is not multi-thread safe.</para>

      <para>The &man.ddb.8; subcommands for &man.geom.8; now supports
	pagination.</para>

      <para>The &man.futimes.2;, &man.lutimes.2;, and &man.utimes.2;
	system call now support a sysctl variable
	<varname>vfs.timestamp_precision</varname>.</para>

      <para>The &man.jail.8; subsystem now supports
	<varname>security.jail.ip4_saddrsel</varname> and
	<varname>security.jail.ip6_saddrsel</varname> sysctl variables
	to control whether to use source address selection or the
	primary jail address for unbound outgoing connections.  The
	default is that the source address selection is enabled.
	Also, the jail parameter <varname>ip4.saddrsel</varname> and
	<varname>ip6.saddrsel</varname> are boolean option to enable
	the source address selection for IPv4 and IPv6, respectively.
	If another boolean parameters
	<varname>ip4.nosaddrsel</varname> and
	<varname>ip6.nosaddrsel</varname> are set, the child jails do
	not inherit the address selection options of the
	parent.</para>

      <para arch="amd64">The <varname>kmem_map</varname> KVA space has
	been increased to 512GB.</para>

      <para>The &man.lindev.4; driver has been added.  This is for
	linux-specific pseudo devices and currently used only for
	<filename>/dev/full</filename>.</para>

      <para>&os; Linux emulation layer now supports
	<varname>SO_PEERCRED</varname> socket option,
	<varname>MSG_CMSG_CLOEXEC</varname> for
	<function>recvmsg()</function>, and robust futex.  The futex
	has been reimplemented by using &man.sx.9; lock.  Initial
	support of &man.ktr.4; tracing has also been added.</para>

      <para>A lock handling error has been fixed in interaction
	between &man.malloc.3; implementation and threading library.
	When a multi-threaded process calls the &man.fork.2; system
	call in a thread and the &man.malloc.3; function in another
	thread, it caused a deadlock in the child process.</para>

      <para>PECOFF image activator support has been removed.</para>

      <para>&os; now supports POSIX semaphores
	(<varname>P1003_1B_SEMAPHORES</varname> kernel option) by
	default.</para>

      <para>A deadlock in the &man.sched.ule.4; scheduler has been
	fixed.  For more details, see <ulink
	  url="http://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-EN-10:02.sched_ule.asc">EN-10:02.sched_ule</ulink>.</para>

      <para>&os; now supports shared memory segments for System V IPC
	which is larger than 2GB on 64-bit platforms.  For more
	details, see <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename>
	file.</para>

      <para>The &man.sglist.9; API to manage scatter/gather lists of
	physical addresses has been added.</para>

      <para>&os; ABI of some of the structures used by the System V
	IPC API has been changed internally.  For new kernel modules,
	the <function>kern_msgctl()</function>,
	<function>kern_semctl()</function>, and
	<function>kern_shmctl()</function> functions will be
	transparently renamed to the new
	<function>kern_new_*()</function> functions by using ABI
	shims.  The old functions remain as the old names to provide
	backward compatibility for older kernel modules.</para>

      <para arch="amd64">The <application>superpages</application> in
	the &os; virtual memory subsystem is now enabled by
	default.</para>

      <para>A new sysctl variable
	<varname>security.bsd.map_at_zero</varname> has been added and
	set to <literal>1</literal> (allow) by default.  This controls
	whether &os; allows to map an object at the address
	<literal>0</literal>, which is part of the user-controlled
	portion of the virtual address space.  Disabling this has some
	effect on preventing an attack which injects malicious code
	into that location and triggers a NULL pointer dereference in
	the kernel.</para>

      <sect3 id="boot">
	<title>Boot Loader Changes</title>

	<para>A new boot loader <literal>gptzfsboot</literal>, which
	  support GPT and ZFS has been added.</para>

	<para>The boot loader <literal>zfsboot</literal> now always
	  uses 64-bit LBAs and supports more than seven drives in the
	  ZFS pools.</para>

	<para>A bug in <literal>zfsboot</literal> has been fixed.  A
	  <filename>/boot.config</filename> smaller than 512 bytes
	  was ignored.</para>

	<para><literal>zfsloader</literal>, the final boot loader
	  similar to &man.loader.8; which supports ZFS has been
	  added.</para>

	<para>A bug in the boot loader has been fixed.  It failed to
	  recognize GPT correctly when the system supports both of MBR
	  and GPT and they are synchronized with each other.</para>

	<para arch="pc98">The <application>boot2</application> program
	  has been replaced with the latest version for
	  &arch.i386;.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="proc">
	<title>Hardware Support</title>

	<para>The <application>amdsbwd(4)</application> driver for AMD
	  SB600/SB7xx watchdog timer has been added.</para>

	<para>The &man.cpuctl.4; driver now supports atomically
	  setting/clearing individual bits of a MSR register.  Two new
	  ioctl calls <varname>CPUCTL_MSRSBIT</varname> and
	  <varname>CPUCTL_MSRCBIT</varname> treat the data field of
	  struct in the argument passed as a mask and set/clear bits
	  of the MSR register according to the mask value.  The
	  &man.cpucontrol.8; utility also supports this feature.  For
	  more details, see Userland Changes section.</para>

	<para>The &man.cpufreq.4; driver now supports Phenom (Family
	  10h).</para>

	<para arch="amd64,i386">CPU cache flushing has been optimized
	  when changing caching attributes of pages by doing nothing
	  for CPUs that support self-snooping and using
	  <literal>CLFLUSH</literal> instead of a full cache
	  invalidate when possible.  &os; does not use
	  <literal>CLFLUSH</literal> on Intel CPUs due to problems
	  with flushing the local APIC range by default.  This can be
	  controlled via the <varname>hw.clflush_disable</varname>
	  loader tunable.  A setting of <literal>1</literal> disables
	  the use of <literal>CLFLUSH</literal>.  A setting of
	  <literal>0</literal> allows <literal>CLFLUSH</literal> to be
	  used for Intel CPUs when <literal>CPUID_SS</literal> is not
	  present.  This fixes a kernel panic occurred on Xen which
	  disables self-snooping.</para>

	<para arch="sparc64">The epic(4) driver for the front panel
	  LEDs in Sun Fire V215/V245 has been added.</para>

	<para arch="sparc64">The fire(4) driver for
	  <quote>Fire</quote> JBus to PCIe bridges found in at least
	  the Sun Fire V215/V245 and Sun Ultra 25/45 machines has been
	  added.</para>

	<para arch="amd64,i386">The &man.hwpmc.4; driver for Hardware
	  Performance Monitoring Counter support has been added.  This
	  consists of the kernel driver, &man.pmc.3; interface
	  library, and userland utilities &man.pmcannotate.8;,
	  pmccontrol.8;, and &man.pmcstat.8;, and allows applications
	  to use hardware performance counters to gather performance
	  data about specific processes or for the system as a
	  whole.</para>

	<para>Several bugs in the &man.ipmi.4; driver which prevents
	  the watchdog timeout setting from working, have been
	  fixed.</para>

	<para>The &man.k8temp.4; driver has been renamed with
	  &man.amdtemp.4;.  The new driver supports AMD K10 and K11 as
	  well as K8.</para>

	<para>A loader tunable <varname>hw.mca.enabled</varname> has
	  been added.  This can be used to enable/disable the machine
	  check code.  Disabled by default.</para>

	<para>A sysctl variable <varname>hw.pagesizes</varname> has
	  been added.  This reports all of the supported page sizes on
	  the system.</para>

	<para>PCI Express memory-mapped configuration space access,
	  ACPI MCFG table support, and BAR (Base Address Register)
	  handling in the &man.pci.4; subsystem has been improved.
	  This is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting a
	  loader tunable <varname>hw.pci.mcfg</varname> to
	  <literal>1</literal>.  This value can be queried via a
	  sysctl variable of the same name.</para>

	<para arch="amd64,i386">&os; now supports VIA Nano processor
	  family.</para>

	<sect4 id="mm">
	  <title>Multimedia Support</title>

	  <para><application>DRM</application> now supports Radeon HD
	    4200 (RS880), 4770 (RV740), and R6/7xx 3D, and Intel G41
	    chips.</para>

	  <para>The vgapci(4) driver for PCI VGA display devices
	    which can attach devices as the children now supports
	    proxying of PCI MSI/MSI-X (Message Signaled Interrupt)
	    requests and bus interrupt requests for the child devices.
	    This allows child devices to use MSI/MSI-X interrupts.</para>
	</sect4>

	<sect4 id="net-if">
	  <title>Network Interface Support</title>

	  <para>The &man.alc.4; driver for Atheros AR8131/AR8132 PCIe
	    Ethernet controller has been added.</para>

	  <para>A bug in the &man.bce.4; driver has been fixed.  When
	    adding a &man.bce.4; interface on the system as a
	    &man.lagg.4; member with the LACP aggregation protocol
	    enabled network communication via the &man.bce.4;
	    interface stopped completely.  Although the &man.bce.4;
	    interface worked if it was not a &man.lagg.4; member, the
	    incoming traffic statistics which can be found in
	    &man.netstat.1; output was incorrect because every packet
	    was recognized as full-sized one.</para>

	  <para>Several bugs in the &man.bge.4; driver have been
	    fixed.  It caused a panic when a lot of traffic is being
	    handled on the interface while the system is shutting
	    down, and had a DMA issue when buffer address crosses a
	    multiple of the 4GB boundaries.</para>

	  <para>The &man.bge.4; driver now supports TSO (TCP
	    segmentation offloading) for BCM5755 or newer
	    chips.</para>

	  <para arch="sparc64">The &man.cas.4; driver has been added
	    to provide support for Sun Cassini/Cassini+ and National
	    Semiconductor DP83065 Saturn Gigabit Ethernet
	    devices.</para>

	  <para>The &man.cxgb.4; driver has been upgraded to the
	    latest version.  The firmware version is 7.8.0.</para>

	  <para>The &man.et.4; driver now supports IPv4/TCP/UDP Tx
	    checksum offloading.</para>

	  <para>The &man.fxp.4; driver has been improved.  The
	    multicast filter re-programming is now more robust.  A bug
	    which caused incorrect IP packet length in the header when
	    TSO (TCP segmentation offloading) is enabled has been
	    fixed.  This fixes poor performance when TSO is enabled in
	    the previous releases.</para>

	  <para>The &man.msk.4; driver has been improved for robust
	    operation.  Also, it now supports Yukon FE+ A0 including
	    88E8040, 88E8040T, 88E8042, 88E8048, 88E8057, and
	    88E8070.</para>

	  <para>Several bugs in the &man.mxge.4; driver have been
	    fixed and the firmware version is now 1.4.48b.  It could
	    lost the promiscuous flag on resetting and a kernel panic
	    on the hardware fault.</para>

	  <para>A bug in the &man.nfe.4; driver has been fixed.  It
	    caused buffer allocation failure for jumbo frames.</para>

	  <para>The &man.nge.4; driver has been improved and now works
	    on all supported platforms.  It now supports &man.altq.4;,
	    hardware checksum offloading for &man.vlan.4; tagged
	    frames, WoL (Wake-on-Lan), jumbo frames, and PCI MWI
	    (Memory Write and Invalidate) commands.  Hardware MAC
	    statistics can be obtained via a new sysctl variable
	    <varname>dev.nge.<replaceable>N</replaceable>.stats</varname>.
	    Another new sysctl variable
	    <varname>dev.nge.<replaceable>N</replaceable>.int_holdoff</varname>
	    has been added to control interrupt moderation.  The valid
	    ranges are <literal>1</literal> (100us) to
	    <literal>255</literal>, and the actual delivery of
	    interrupt would be delayed based on this value.  The
	    default is <literal>1</literal>.  For more details, see
	    &man.nge.4; manual page.</para>

	  <para>The &man.ste.4; driver has been improved and now works

	option.  If no <option>-A</option> is specified,
	<hostid>whois.radb.net</hostid> will be used as the default value.</para>

      <para>The &man.tzsetup.8; command now supports an
	<option>-s</option> option to skip the initial question about
	adjusting the clock if not set to UTC.</para>

      <para>The &man.whois.1; utility has been updated.  A
	<option>-d</option> option has been removed because
	<hostid>whois.nic.mil</hostid> no longer exists, and it
	supports searching for IPv6 addresses just like it can do for
	IPv4 addresses without having to explicitly specify that the
	ARIN server should be used to get the initial
	information.</para>
