  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current;.  It
    describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
    It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

<![ %release.type.current [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents the latest point along the &release.branch; development
    branch since &release.branch; was created.  Information regarding pre-built, binary
    &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

]]>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents a point along the &release.branch; development
    branch between &release.prev; and the future &release.next;.
    Information regarding
    pre-built, binary &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

]]>

<![ %release.type.release [

  <para>This distribution of &os; &release.current; is a
    &release.type; distribution.  It can be found at <ulink
    url="&release.url;"></ulink> or any of its mirrors.  More
    information on obtaining this (or other) &release.type;
    distributions of &os; can be found in the <ulink
    url="&url.books.handbook;/mirrors.html"><quote>Obtaining
    &os;</quote> appendix</ulink> to the <ulink

  <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
    installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
    <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
    release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
    information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
    documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
    &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes
    the most user-visible new or changed features in &os;
    since &release.prev;.
  </para>

  <para>Typical release note items
    document recent security advisories issued after
    &release.prev;,
    new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades.  They may also
    list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
    practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot list every single
    change made to &os; between releases; this document focuses
    primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major
    architectural improvements.</para>

  <sect2 id="kernel">
    <title>Kernel Changes</title>

    <para>The &man.ddb.4; kernel debugger now has an output capture
      facility.  Input and output from &man.ddb.4; can now be captured
      to a memory buffer for later inspection using &man.sysctl.8; or
      a textdump.  The new <command>capture</command> command controls
      this feature.</para>

    <para>The &man.ddb.4; debugger now supports a simple scripting
      facility, which supports a set of named scripts consisting of a
      set of &man.ddb.4; commands.  These commands can be managed from
      within &man.ddb.4; or with the use of the new &man.ddb.8;
      utility.  More details can be found in the &man.ddb.4; manual
      page.</para>

    <para>The kernel now supports a new textdump format of kernel
      dumps.  A textdump provides higher-level information via
      mechanically generated/extracted debugging output, rather than a
      simple memory dump.  This facility can be used to generate brief
      kernel bug reports that are rich in debugging information, but
      are not dependent on kernel symbol tables or precisely
      synchronized source code.  More information can be found in the
      &man.textdump.4; manual page.</para>

    <para>[&arch.amd64;, &arch.i386;] The ULE
      scheduler is now the default process scheduler
      in <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernels.</para>

    <sect3 id="boot">
      <title>Boot Loader Changes</title>

      <para></para>

      <para>[&arch.amd64;, &arch.i386;] The BTX kernel used by the boot
	loader has been changed to invoke BIOS routines from real
	mode.  This change makes it possible to boot &os; from USB
	devices.</para>

      <para>[&arch.amd64;, &arch.i386;] A new gptboot boot loader has
        been added to support booting from a GPT labeled disk.  A
        new <command>boot</command> command has been added to
        &man.gpt.8;, which makes a GPT disk bootable by writing the
        required bits of the boot loader, creating a new boot
        partition if required.</para>

      <para>The &man.cmx.4; driver, a driver for Omnikey CardMan 4040

      <para>The &man.uslcom.4; driver, a driver for Silicon
        Laboratories CP2101/CP2102-based USB serial adapters, has been

    <para>The &man.adduser.8; utility now supports
      a <option>-M</option> option to set the mode of a new user's
      home directory.</para>

    <para>&man.chflags.1; now supports a <option>-v</option> flag for
      verbose output and a <option>-f</option> flag to ignore errors
      with the same semantics as (for example)
      &man.chmod.1;.</para>

    <para>The &man.realpath.1; utility now supports
      a <option>-q</option> flag to suppress warnings; it now also
      accepts multiple paths on its command line.</para>

    <para>&man.cron.8; now supports a <option>-m</option> option,
      which can help managing cron mails in massive hosting
      environment.</para>

    <para>&man.ypserv.8; now supports a <option>-P</option> option to
      specify the port number on which it should listen.</para>

  <title>Upgrading from previous releases of &os;</title>

  <para>[&arch.i386;, &arch.amd64;] Beginning with &os; 6.2-RELEASE,
    binary upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of the
    various security branches) are supported using the
    &man.freebsd-update.8; utility.  The binary upgrade procedure will
    update unmodified userland utilities, as well as unmodified GENERIC or
    SMP kernels distributed as a part of an official &os; release.
    The &man.freebsd-update.8; utility requires that the host being
    upgraded have Internet connectivity.</para>

  <para>An older form of binary upgrade is supported through the
    <command>Upgrade</command> option from the main &man.sysinstall.8;
    menu on CDROM distribution media.  This type of binary upgrade
    may be useful on non-&arch.i386;, non-&arch.amd64; machines
    or on systems with no Internet connectivity.</para>

  <para>Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the &os;
    base system from source code) from previous versions are
    supported, according to the instructions in
    <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename>.</para>

  <important>
    <para>Upgrading &os; should, of course, only be attempted after
      backing up <emphasis>all</emphasis> data and configuration
      files.</para>
