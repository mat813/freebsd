    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
      &release.current;.  It
      describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
      It also provides some notes on upgrading
      from previous versions of &os;.</para>

<![ %release.type.current [

    <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
      apply represents the latest point along the &release.branch; development
      branch since &release.branch; was created.  Information regarding pre-built, binary
      &release.type; distributions along this branch
      can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

]]>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

    <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
      apply represents a point along the &release.branch; development
      branch between &release.prev; and the future &release.next;.
      Information regarding
      pre-built, binary &release.type; distributions along this branch
      can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

]]>

<![ %release.type.release [

    <para>This distribution of &os; &release.current; is a
      &release.type; distribution.  It can be found at <ulink
      url="&release.url;"></ulink> or any of its mirrors.  More
      information on obtaining this (or other) &release.type;
      distributions of &os; can be found in the <ulink
      url="&url.books.handbook;/mirrors.html"><quote>Obtaining
      &os;</quote> appendix</ulink> to the <ulink
      url="&url.books.handbook;/">&os; Handbook</ulink>.</para>

]]>

    <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
      installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
      <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
      release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
      information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
      documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
      &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

  <sect1 id="new">
    <title>What's New</title>

    <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
      features in &os; since &release.prev;.</para>

    <para>Typical release note items document recent security
      advisories issued after &release.prev;, new drivers or hardware
      support, new commands or options, major bug fixes, or
      contributed software upgrades.  They may also list changes to
      major ports/packages or release engineering practices.  Clearly
      the release notes cannot list every single change made to &os;
      between releases; this document focuses primarily on security
      advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
      improvements.</para>

    <sect2 id="security">
      <title>Security Advisories</title>

      <para>Problems described in the following security advisories have
	been fixed.  For more information, consult the individual
	advisories available from

	    chipsets.</para>

	  <para>The DRM, a kernel module named Direct Rendering
	    Manager that gives direct hardware access to DRI clients,
	    has been updated.  Support for AMD/ATI r500 and IGP based
	    chips, XGI V3XE/V5/V8, and Intel i915 chipsets has been
	    improved.</para>

	  <para>The &man.snd.hda.4; driver has been updated.  Changes
	    include: multiple codec per HDA bus, multiple functional
	    gropups per codec, multiple audio devices per functional
	    group, digital (SPDIF/HDMI) audio input/output,
	    suspend/resume, and part of multichannel audio.</para>

	  <para>Note that due to added HDMI audio and logical audio
	    devices support, updated driver often provides several PCM
	    devices.  In some cases it can make system default audio
	    device no longer corresponding to the users's habbitual
	    audio connectors.  In such cases the default device can be
	    specified in audio application setup or defined globally
	    via <varname>hw.snd.default_unit sysctl</varname>
	    as described in the &man.sound.4; manual page.</para>

	  transfers.</para>

	<para>The &man.sdhci.4; driver has been added.  This supports
	  PCI devices with class 8 and subclass 5 accord- ing to SD Host
	  Controller Specification.</para>

	will enable certain aggressive operations that can make
	&man.fsck.8; to survive with file systems that has very

	messages for a NAT rule even when a <option>-q</option> flag
	is specified.</para>

      <para>The &man.powerd.8; program has been improved.  Changes
	include reasonable CPU load estimation on SMP systems and a
	new mode named as <literal>hiadaptive</literal> for AC-powered
	systems which rises frequency twice faster, drops it 4 times
	slower, prefers twice lower CPU load and has additional delay
	before leaving the highest frequency after the period of
	maximum load.</para>

      <para>The &man.strndup.3; function has been added.</para>

      <para>A bug in the &man.rpc.yppasswdd.8; program which leaves a

    <para arch="amd64,i386">Beginning with &os; 6.2-RELEASE, binary
      upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of the various
      security branches) are supported using the
      &man.freebsd-update.8; utility.  The binary upgrade procedure
      will update unmodified userland utilities, as well as unmodified
      GENERIC or SMP kernels distributed as a part of an official &os;
      release.  The &man.freebsd-update.8; utility requires that the

    <para>An older form of binary upgrade is supported through the
      <command>Upgrade</command> option from the main
      &man.sysinstall.8; menu on CDROM distribution media.  This type
