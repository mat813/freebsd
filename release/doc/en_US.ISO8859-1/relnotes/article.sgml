  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current;.	It
    describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
    It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

<![ %release.type.current [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents the latest point along the &release.branch; development
    branch since &release.branch; was created.	Information regarding pre-built, binary
    &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

]]>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents a point along the &release.branch; development
    branch between &release.prev; and the future &release.next;.
    Information regarding
    pre-built, binary &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

]]>

<![ %release.type.release [

  <para>This distribution of &os; &release.current; is a
    &release.type; distribution.  It can be found at <ulink
    url="&release.url;"></ulink> or any of its mirrors.	 More
    information on obtaining this (or other) &release.type;
    distributions of &os; can be found in the <ulink

    &os;</quote> appendix</ulink> to the <ulink
    url="&url.books.handbook;/">&os;
    Handbook</ulink>.</para>

]]>

  <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
    installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
    <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
    release cycle or after the release.	 Typically, it contains
    information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
    documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
    &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

  <sect1 id="new">
    <title>What's New</title>

    <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
      features in &os; since &release.prev;.</para>

    <para>Typical release note items document recent security
      advisories issued after &release.prev;, new drivers or hardware
      support, new commands or options, major bug fixes, or
      contributed software upgrades.  They may also list changes to
      major ports/packages or release engineering practices.  Clearly
      the release notes cannot list every single change made to &os;
      between releases; this document focuses primarily on security
      advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
      improvements.</para>

    <sect2 id="security">
      <title>Security Advisories</title>

      <para>Problems described in the following security advisories have

      <title>Kernel Changes</title>

      <para revision="219107" arch="amd64,i386">The &os;
	&man.dtrace.1; framework now supports
	<literal>systrace</literal> for system calls of
	<literal>linux32</literal> and <literal>freebsd32</literal> on
	&os;/&arch.amd64;.  Two new
	<filename>systrace_linux32</filename> and
	<filename>systrace_freebsd32</filename> kernel modules provide
	support for tracing compat system calls in addition to the native
	system call tracing provided by the
	<filename>systrace</filename> module.</para>

      <para revision="222406">The &man.hhook.9; (Helper Hook)
	and &man.khelp.9; (Kernel Helpers) KPIs have been implemented.
	These are a kind of superset of &man.pfil.9; framework for
	more general use in the kernel.  The &man.hhook.9; KPI
	provides a way for kernel subsystems to export hook points
	that &man.khelp.9; modules can hook to provide enhanced or new
	functionality to the kernel.  The &man.khelp.9; KPI provides a
	framework for managing &man.khelp.9; modules, which indirectly
	use the &man.hhook.9; KPI to register their hook functions
	with hook points of interest within the kernel.  These allow a
	structured way to dynamically extend the kernel at runtime in
	an ABI preserving manner.</para>

      <para revision="230282" arch="amd64,i386,pc98">A &man.loader.8;
	tunable <varname>hw.memtest.tests</varname> has been added.
	This controls whether to perform memory testing at boot time
	or not.  The default value is <literal>1</literal> (perform a
	memory test).</para>

      <para revision="220241">The &man.open.2; and &man.fhopen.2;
	system calls now support the <literal>O_CLOEXEC</literal> flag,
	which allows setting the <literal>FD_CLOEXEC</literal> flag for the
	newly created file descriptor.  This is standardized in IEEE
	Std 1003.1-2008 (POSIX, Single UNIX Specification Version
	4).</para>

      <para revision="227573">The &man.posix.fallocate.2; system call has
	been implemented.  This is a function in POSIX to ensure that
	a part of the storage for regular file data is allocated on the
	file system storage media.</para>

      <para revision="229725">The &man.posix.fadvise.2; system call
	has been implemented.  This is a function in POSIX similar to
	&man.madvise.2; except that it operates on a file descriptor
	instead of a memory region.</para>

      <sect3 id="proc">
	<title>Hardware Support</title>

	<para revision="221174">The &os; &man.usb.4; subsystem now
	  supports USB packet filter.  This allows to capture packets
	  which go through each USB host controller.  The
	  implementation is almost based on &man.bpf.4; code.
	  The userland program &man.usbdump.8; has been added.</para>

	  <para revision="223394">The &man.msk.4; driver now supports
	    RX checksum offloading for Yukon EC, Yukon Ultra, Yukon FE
	    and Yukon Ultra2.  The checksum offloading for Yukon XL
	    was still disabled due to known silicon bug.</para>

	  <para revision="218872">A bug in the &man.nfe.4; driver which
	    could prevent reinitialization after changing the MTU has
	    been fixed.</para>

	  <para revision="218294">A rdcphy(4) driver for RDC Semiconductor
	    R6040 10/100 PHY has been added.</para>

	  <para revision="218901,219116">The &man.re.4; driver now supports

	    RTL8401E PCIe Fast Ethernet controllers.</para>

	  <para revision="218905">The &man.re.4; driver now supports
	    TX interrupt moderation on RTL810xE PCIe Fast Ethernet
	    controllers.</para>

	  <para revision="219110">The &man.re.4; driver now supports
	    another mechanism for RX interrupt moderation because of
	    performance problems.  A &man.sysctl.8; variable
	    <varname>dev.re.<replaceable>N</replaceable>.int_rx_mod</varname>
	    has been added to control amount of time to delay RX
	    interrupt processing, in units of microsecond.  Setting it
	    to <literal>0</literal> completely disables RX interrupt
	    moderation.  A &man.loader.8; tunable
	    <varname>hw.re.intr_filter</varname> controls whether the
	    old mechanism utilizing MSI/MSI-X capability on
	    supported controllers is used or not.  When set to
	    a non-zero value, the &man.re.4; driver uses the old
	    mechanism.  The default value is <literal>0</literal> and
	    this tunable has no effect on controllers without MSI/MSI-X
	    capability.</para>

	  <para revision="218897">The &man.re.4; driver now
	    supports TSO (TCP Segmentation Offload) on RealTek
	    RTL8168/8111 C or later controllers.  Note that this is
	    disabled by default because broken frames can be sent
	    under certain conditions.</para>

	  <para revision="218899,219114">The &man.re.4; driver now
	    supports enabling TX and/or RX checksum offloading
	    independently from each other.  Note that TX IP checksum
	    is disabled on some RTL8168C-based network interfaces
	    because it can generate an incorrect IP checksum when the
	    packet contains IP options.</para>

	  <para revision="229530">The &man.re.4; driver now supports
	    RTL8105E PCIe Fast Ethernet controllers.</para>

	  <para revision="218296">A &man.vte.4; driver for RDC R6040 Fast

	<para revision="230575">&man.ipfw.8; now supports the

	  actions.  Upon the <command>call
	  <replaceable>number</replaceable></command> action, the
	  current rule number is saved in the internal stack and
	  ruleset processing continues with the first rule numbered

	  Hashed Message Authentication Mode (HMAC-SHA-256,
	  HMAC-SHA-384, and HMAC-SHA-512) as described in RFC 4868.
	  This was a fixed 96-bit length in prior releases because the
	  implementation was based on an old Internet draft
	  draft-ietf-ipsec-ciph-sha-256-00.  Note that this means
	  &release.current; and later are no longer interoperable with

	  this flag keyword.</para>

	<para revision="226926">A &man.loader.8; tunable
