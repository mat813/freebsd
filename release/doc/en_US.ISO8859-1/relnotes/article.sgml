    <title>What's New</title>

    <para>This section describes
      the most user-visible new or changed features in &os;
      since &release.prev;.</para>

    <para>Typical release note items
      document recent security advisories issued after
      &release.prev;,
      new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
      major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades.  They may also
      list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
      practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot list every single
      change made to &os; between releases; this document focuses
      primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major
      architectural improvements.</para>

      <title>Security Advisories</title>

      <para>Problems described in the following security advisories have
	been fixed.  For more information, consult the individual

    <sect2 id="kernel">
      <title>Kernel Changes</title>

      <para>The &man.clock.gettime.2; and the related system calls now
	support a clock ID <literal>CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID</literal>,
	defined in POSIX.</para>

      <para>The &man.cpuset.2; system call has been added.  This is an
	API for thread to CPU binding and CPU resource grouping and
	assignment.</para>

      <para>The DTrace, a comprehensive dynamic tracing framework and
	&man.dtrace.1; userland utility have been imported from
	OpenSolaris.  DTrace provides a powerful infrastructure to
	permit administrators, developers, and service personnel to
	concisely answer arbitrary questions about the behavior of the
	operating system and user programs.</para>

      <para>The &man.ddb.4; kernel debugger now has an output capture
	facility.  Input and output from &man.ddb.4; can now be captured
	to a memory buffer for later inspection using &man.sysctl.8; or
	a textdump.  The new <command>capture</command> command controls
	this feature.</para>

      <para>The &man.ddb.4; debugger now supports a simple scripting
	facility, which supports a set of named scripts consisting of a
	set of &man.ddb.4; commands.  These commands can be managed from
	within &man.ddb.4; or with the use of the new &man.ddb.8;
	utility.  More details can be found in the &man.ddb.4; manual
	page.</para>

      <para>The &man.ddb.4; <command>ex</command> command now supports
	an <option>/S</option> mode which interprets and prints the
	value at the requested address as a symbol.  For example,
	<userinput>ex /S <replaceable>aio_swake</replaceable></userinput>
	prints the name of the function currently registered in
	via <replaceable>aio_swake</replaceable> hook.</para>

      <para>The &man.ddb.4; <command>show conifhk</command> command has
	been added.  This lists hooks currently waiting for completion
	in <function>run_interrupt_driven_config_hooks()</function>.</para>

      <para>The &man.fcntl.2; system call now supports
	<literal>F_DUP2FD</literal> command.  This is equivalent to
	&man.dup.2;, and compatible with Sun Solaris and IBM AIX.</para>

      <para>The &os;'s &man.linux.4; ABI support now implements
	<function>sched_setaffinity()</function> and
	<function>sched_getaffinity()</function> using real CPU affinity
	setting primitives.</para>

      <para>The client side functionality of &man.rpc.lockd.8; has been
	implemented in &os; kernel.  This implementation provides the
	correct semantics for &man.flock.2; style locks which are used
	by the &man.lockf.1; command line tool and the &man.pidfile.3;
	library.  It also implements recovery from server restarts and
	ensures that dirty cache blocks are written to the server before
	obtaining locks (allowing multiple clients to use file locking
	to safely share data).  Also, a new kernel option
	<literal>options NFSLOCKD</literal> has been added and enabled
	by default.  If the kernel support is enabled, &man.rpc.lockd.8;
	automatically detects and uses the functionality.</para>

      <para>The &os; kernel now supports a new textdump format of kernel
	dumps.  A textdump provides higher-level information via
	mechanically generated/extracted debugging output, rather than a
	simple memory dump.  This facility can be used to generate brief
	kernel bug reports that are rich in debugging information, but
	are not dependent on kernel symbol tables or precisely
	synchronized source code.  More information can be found in the
	&man.textdump.4; manual page.</para>

      <para>The &man.wait4.2; system call now supports
	<option>WNOWAIT</option> flag to keep the process whose status
	is returned in a waitable state and <option>WSTOPPED</option>
	which is equivalent to <option>WUNTRACED</option>.</para>

      <para arch="amd64,i386,sparc64">The &os; kernel now supports
	initial support of binding interrupts to CPUs.</para>

      <para arch="amd64,i386"> The &man.sched.ule.4; scheduler is now the default
	process scheduler in <filename>GENERIC</filename>
	kernels.</para>

      <para>The sysctl
	variables <varname>kern.features.compat_freebsd[456]</varname>
	have been added.  These are corresponding to the kernel options
	<literal>COMPAT_FREEBSD[456]</literal>.</para>

      <sect3 id="boot">
	<title>Boot Loader Changes</title>

	<para arch="amd64,i386">The BTX kernel used by the boot
	  loader has been changed to invoke BIOS routines from real
	  mode.  This change makes it possible to boot &os; from USB
	  devices.</para>

	<para arch="amd64,i386">A new gptboot boot loader has
          been added to support booting from a GPT labeled disk.  A
          new <command>boot</command> command has been added to
          &man.gpt.8;, which makes a GPT disk bootable by writing the
          required bits of the boot loader, creating a new boot
          partition if required.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="proc">
	<title>Hardware Support</title>

	<para>The &man.cmx.4; driver, a driver for Omnikey CardMan 4040
          PCMCIA smartcard readers, has been added.</para>

	<para arch="sparc64">The &man.kbdmux.4; driver has been added.
	  The &man.sunkbd.4; now supports &man.atkbd.4; emulation like
	  &man.ukbd.4;.</para>

	<para>The <filename>nvram(4)</filename> driver is now
	  MPSAFE.</para>

	<para>An option of the &man.puc.4;
	  driver <literal>PUC_FASTINTR</literal> has been no longer
	  supported.</para>

	<para>The &man.psm.4; driver now attempts detection of Synaptics
	  touchpad before IntelliMouse.  Some touchpads will pretend to
	  be IntelliMouse causing the IntelliMouse probe to work and the
	  Synaptics detection never to be done.</para>

	<para>The &man.uslcom.4; driver, a driver for Silicon
          Laboratories CP2101/CP2102-based USB serial adapters, has been
          imported from OpenBSD.</para>

	<sect4 id="mm">
	  <title>Multimedia Support</title>

	  <para>The &man.agp.4; driver now supports Intel G33 and
	    G45.</para>

	  <para arch="i386">The <filename>dpms(4)</filename> driver has
	    been added to use the VESA BIOS for DPMS during suspend and
	    resume.</para>

	  <para>The <application>DRM</application> kernel driver now
	    supports i915 GME devices.</para>
	</sect4>

	<sect4 id="net-if">
	  <title>Network Interface Support</title>

	  <para>The &man.ale.4; driver has been added to provide support
	    for Atheros AR8121/AR8113/AR8114 Gigabit/Fast Ethernet controllers.
	    This driver is not enabled in <filename>GENERIC</filename>
	    kernels for this release.</para>

	  <para>The &man.em.4; driver has been split into two drivers
	    with some common parts.  The &man.em.4; driver will continue
	    to support adapters up to the 82575, as well as new
	    client/desktop adapters.  A new &man.igb.4; driver
	    will support new server adapters.</para>

	  <para>The &man.hme.4; driver has been improved.</para>

	  <para>The &man.ixgbe.4; driver has been updated to version
	    1.6.2 from Intel.</para>

	  <para>A bug in some of the &man.miibus.4; supported drivers that
	    IEEE 802.3 auto-negotiation was performed in a wrong order,
	    has been fixed.  Now it chooses the correct technologies
	    supported by IEEE 802.3 in the order described in Annex
	    28B.3.</para>

	  <para>A workaround has been added for a bug in TCP/UDP
	    hardware checksum offload of the &man.msk.4; driver for
	    short frames.  Note that for frames that requires hardware
	    VLAN tag insertion, the checksum offload workaround does not
	    work due to changes of checksum offset in mbuf after the
	    VLAN tag.  So disabling hardware checksum offload for the
	    VLAN interface is needed in such cases.</para>

	  <para>The &man.ndis.4; NDIS miniport driver wrapper has been
	    improved.</para>

	  <para>The &man.sf.4; driver has been improved and now supports
	    checksum offloading.</para>

	  <para>The &man.stge.4; driver now supports WOL (Wake on
	    LAN).</para>

	  <para>The &man.vr.4; driver has been improved.</para>

	  <para arch="amd64,i386"> The &man.wpi.4; driver has
	    been updated to include a number of stability fixes.</para>
	</sect4>
      </sect3>

      <sect3 id="net-proto">
	<title>Network Protocols</title>

	<para>The &man.arp.8; utility now
	  supports <literal>reject</literal>
	  and <literal>blackhole</literal> keywords.  In the entry
	  marked as <literal>reject</literal>, traffic to the host will
	  be discarded and the sender will be notified the host is
	  unreachable.  In the entry marked as <literal>blackhole</literal>,
	  traffic is discarded but the sender is not notified.</para>

	<para>The &man.bpf.4; now supports an
	  ioctl <literal>BIOCSETFNR</literal>.  This is just like
	  <literal>BIOCSETF</literal> but it does not drop all the
	  packets buffered on the descriptor and reset the
	  statistics.</para>

	<para>The &man.if.bridge.4; now allow to limit the number of
	  source MACs that can be behind a bridge interface
	  via <literal>ifmaxaddr</literal> parameter of
	  &man.ifconfig.8;.</para>

	<para>A bug in the &man.carp.4; interface configuration which
	  leads to a system panic has been fixed.</para>

	<para>The &man.dummynet.4; subsystem now supports
	  <literal>fast</literal> mode operation which allows certain
	  packets to bypass the dummynet scheduler.  This can achieve
	  lower latency and lower overhead when the packet flow is under
	  the pipe bandwidth, and eliminate recursion in the subsystem.
	  The new sysctl variable
	  <varname>net.inet.ip.dummynet.io_fast</varname> has been
	  added to enable this feature.</para>

	<para>The &man.enc.4; now supports sysctl variables to
	  control whether the firewalls or &man.bpf.4; will see inner
	  and outer headers or just inner or outer headers for incoming
	  and outgoing IPsec packets.</para>

	<para>The &man.gre.4; now supports
	  ioctls <literal>GRESKEY</literal>
	  and <literal>GREGKEY</literal> which allows set or get GRE
	  key used for outgoing packets.</para>

	<para>A bug in the &man.ipsec.4; subsystem that PMTU was broken
	  in those cases when there was a route with a lower MTU than
	  the MTU of the outgoing interface, has been fixed.</para>

	<para>The netatm subsystem has been removed due to
	  lacking of multiprocessor support.</para>

	<para>The &man.ng.nat.4; now supports redirect functionality
	  in <filename>libalias</filename>.  For more details, see the
	  manual page.</para>

	<para>The &man.ng.pptpgre.4; now supports multiple hooks like
	  &man.ng.l2tp.4;, to use one pair of pptpgre and ksocket nodes for all
	  calls between two peers.</para>

	<para>The &man.resolver.3; now allows underscore in domain
	  names.  Although this is a violation of RFC 1034 [STD 13], it is
	  accepted by certain name servers as well as other popular operating
	  systems' resolver library.</para>

	<para>A socket option <literal>TCP_CONGESTION</literal> for TCP
	  socket has been added.  This is for setting and retrieving the
	  congestion control algorithm.  The name used is to allow
	  compatibility with Linux.</para>

	<para>The &man.rwlock.9; has been used throughout
	  the <varname>inpcbinfo</varname> and <varname>inpcb</varname>
	  infrastructure, and protocols that depend on that
	  infrastructure, including UDP, TCP, and IP raw sockets to
	  reduce the lock contentions.</para>

      <sect3 id="disks">
	<title>Disks and Storage</title>

	<para>The &man.aac.4; driver now supports 64-bit array support
	  for RAIDs larger than 2TB and simultaneous opens of the device
	  for issuing commands to the controller.</para>

	<para>The &man.ata.4; driver now supports a loader variable
	  <varname>hw.ata.ata_dma_check_80pin</varname>.  This can be
	  used to disable the 80pin cable check on broken systems such
	  as certain laptops and Soekris boards.  The default value is
	  <literal>1</literal>.</para>

	<para>A data corruption problem of the &man.ata.4; driver on
	  ServerWorks HT1000 chipsets has been fixed.</para>

	<para>The &man.ciss.4; driver now supports a loader tunable
	  <varname>hw.ciss.nop_message_heartbeat</varname> for
	  NOP-message polling in <function>ciss_periodic()</function>.
	  This can be used as a workaround for
	  <literal>ADAPTER HEARTBEAT FAILED</literal> issue.
