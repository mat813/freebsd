    for compatability with other implementations.</para>

    <para>&man.find.1; now has the <option>-anewer</option>,
    <option>-cnewer</option>, <option>-mnewer</option>,
    <option>-okdir</option>, and <option>-newer[acm][acmt]</option>

      have been updated to FSF version 1.17. This import brings in a

      limitations of its predecessor.</para>

      <para>&man.pim6dd.8; and &man.pim6sd.8; have been removed due to
      restrictive licensing conditions.  These programs are available
