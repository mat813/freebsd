  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current; on the &arch.print; hardware platform.  It
    describes new features of &os; that have been added (or changed)
    since &release.prev;.  It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents a point along the &release.branch; development
    branch between &release.prev; and the future &release.next;.  Some
    pre-built, binary &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

<!--
	The "What's New" section of the release notes. 

	Guidelines for new entries:

	1.  If there is some obvious "keyword" associated with an
	entry (such as a manpage entry or an application name), try to
	put it at the start of the sentence.

	2.  Within each subsection (i.e. kernel, security, userland),
	list items in alphabetical order by these keywords.

	Some entries will have no obvious keywords to help with
	ordering.  In sections containing these entries, put those
	containing (e.g.) manpage references first, then some
	suitable SGML comment line as a demarc, then the remaining
	entries.

  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
    features in &os; since &release.prev;.  Typical release note items
    document new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bugfixes, or contributed software upgrades.  Security
    advisories for the base system that were issued after
    &release.prev; are also listed.</para>

  <sect2 id="kernel">
    <title>Kernel Changes</title>

    <para>A new in-kernel cryptographic framework (see &man.crypto.4;
      and &man.crypto.9;) has been imported from OpenBSD.  It provides
      a consistent interface to hardware and software implementations
      of cryptographic algorithms for use by the kernel and access to
      cryptographic hardware for user-mode applications.
      Hardware device drivers are provided to support hifn-based cards
      (&man.hifn.4;) and Broadcom-based cards (&man.ubsec.4;).</para>

    <para arch="i386,pc98">Initial support has been added for
      Firewire devices (see &man.firewire.4;).</para>

    <para>The &man.uftdi.4; driver, to support FTDI USB-to-serial
      devices, has been added.</para>

<!-- Above this line, kernel changes ordered by manpage/variable name -->

    <sect3>
      <title>Network Interface Support</title>

      <para>The &man.nge.4; driver now supports network device
	&man.polling.4;.</para>

<!-- Above this line, order network driver changes by manpage/variable name-->

    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Network Protocols</title>

      <para>A &man.gre.4; driver, which can encapsulate IP packets
        using GRE (RFC 1701) or minimal IP encapsulation for Mobile IP
        (RFC 2004), has been added.</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Disks and Storage</title>

      <para>The &man.ata.4; driver now supports accessing ATA devices
        as SCSI devices via the CAM layer and drivers (&man.cd.4;,
        &man.da.4;, &man.st.4;, and &man.pass.4;).  This feature requires
        <literal>device atapicam</literal> in the kernel
        configuration.  More information can be found in
        &man.atapicam.4;.</para>

      <para arch="i386,pc98">The &man.matcd.4; driver has been removed
        due to licensing issues.  (This removal actually occurred in
        &release.prev;, but was not mentioned in the release
        notes.)</para>

      <para>The trm driver has been added to support SCSI adapters
        using the Tekram TRM-S1040 SCSI chipset.</para>

    <title>Security Advisories</title>

    <para>Buffer overflows in kadmind(8) and k5admin have been
      corrected.  More details can be found in security advisory <ulink

    <para>Multiple vulnerabilities in <application>BIND</application>
      have been fixed, as described in <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-02:43.bind.asc">FreeBSD-SA-02:43</ulink>.</para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="userland">
    <title>Userland Changes</title>

    <para>&man.burncd.8; now accepts a value of <literal>max</literal>
      for its <option>-s</option> option to set the drive's maximum
      write speed.</para>

    <para>&man.cdcontrol.1; now supports a
      <literal>speed</literal> command to set the maximum speed to be
      used by the drive (the maximum possible speed can be selected
      setting the speed to <literal>max</literal>).</para>

    <para>The &man.getconf.1; utility has been added.  It prints the
      values of POSIX or X/Open path or system configuration
      variables.</para>

    <para>The &man.pathchk.1; utility, which checks pathnames for
      validity or portability between POSIX systems, has been
      added.</para>

    <para>The base64 capabilities of &man.uuencode.1; and
      &man.uudecode.1; can now be automatically enabled by invoking
      these utilities as &man.b64encode.1; and &man.b64decode.1;
      respectively.</para>

<!-- Above this line, order userland changes by manpage/variable name-->

    <para>The definitions of the standard file streams
      (<varname>stdio</varname>, <varname>stdout</varname>, and
      <varname>stderr</varname>) have changed so that they are no
      longer compile-time constants.  Some older binaries may require
      updated 3.X compatability libraries (for example, by setting
      <literal>COMPAT3X=yes</literal> for a
      buildworld/installworld).</para>

    <sect3>
      <title>Contributed Software</title>

      <para>All of the <application>bzip2</application> suite of
        applications is now installed in the base system (in
        particular, <command>bzip2recover</command> is now built and
        installed.</para>

      <para><application>cvs</application> has been updated to
	a snapshot of 1.11.2.1, as of 1 December 2002.</para>

      <para><application>Heimdal Kerberos</application> has been updated to
	0.5.1.</para>

      <para>The timezone database has been updated to the
	<filename>tzdata2002d</filename> release.</para>

  <title>Upgrading from previous releases of &os;</title>

  <para>If you're upgrading from a previous release of &os;, you
    generally will have three options:

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Using the binary upgrade option of &man.sysinstall.8;.
	  This option is perhaps the quickest, although it presumes
	  that your installation of &os; uses no special compilation
	  options.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>Performing a complete reinstall of &os;.  Technically,
	  this is not an upgrading method, and in any case is usually less
	  convenient than a binary upgrade, in that it requires you to
	  manually backup and restore the contents of
	  <filename>/etc</filename>.  However, it may be useful in
	  cases where you want (or need) to change the partitioning of
	  your disks.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>From source code in <filename>/usr/src</filename>.  This
	  route is more flexible, but requires more disk space, time,
	  and technical expertise.  More information can be found
	  in the <ulink
	  url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/makeworld.html"><quote>Using
	  <command>make world</command></quote></ulink> section of the <ulink
	  url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/">FreeBSD
	  Handbook</ulink>.  Upgrading from very old
	  versions of &os; may be problematic; in cases like this, it
	  is usually more effective to perform a binary upgrade or a
	  complete reinstall.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>Please read the <filename>INSTALL.TXT</filename> file for more
    information, preferably <emphasis>before</emphasis> beginning an
    upgrade.  If you are upgrading from source, please be sure to read
    <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename> as well.</para>

  <para>Finally, if you want to use one of various means to track the
    -STABLE or -CURRENT branches of &os;, please be sure to consult
    the <ulink
    url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/current-stable.html"><quote>-CURRENT
    vs. -STABLE</quote></ulink> section of the <ulink
    url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/">FreeBSD
    Handbook</ulink>.</para>

  <important>
    <para>Upgrading &os; should, of course, only be attempted after
      backing up <emphasis>all</emphasis> data and configuration
      files.</para>
