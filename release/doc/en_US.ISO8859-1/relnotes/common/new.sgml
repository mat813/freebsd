    <para>The release notes for &os; &release.current; contain a
      summary of the changes made to the &os; base system since
      &release.prev;.  Both changes for kernel and userland are
      listed, as well as applicable security advisories for the base
      system that were issued since the last release.  Some brief
      remarks on upgrading are also presented.</para>

  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current; on the &arch.print; hardware platform.  It
    describes new features of &os; that have been added (or changed)
    since &release.prev;.  It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes

<!--
	The "What's New" section of the release notes. 

	Guidelines for new entries:

	1.  If there is some obvious "keyword" associated with an
	entry (such as a manpage entry or an application name), try to
	put it at the start of the sentence.

	2.  Within each subsection (i.e. kernel, security, userland),
	list items in alphabetical order by these keywords.

	Some entries will have no obvious keywords to help with
	ordering.  In sections containing these entries, put those
	containing (e.g.) manpage references first, then some
	suitable SGML comment line as a demarc, then the remaining
	entries.

<sect1 id="new">
  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
    features in &os; since &release.prev;.  Typical release note items
    document new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bugfixes, or contributed software upgrades.  Security
    advisories for the base system that were issued after
    &release.prev; are also listed.</para>

  <sect2 id="security">
    <title>Security Advisories</title>

    <para>A remotely-exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability in
      <application>sendmail</application> has been fixed.  For more
      details, see security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:07.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:07</ulink>.
      In &os; &release.prev;, this vulnerability was fixed using a
      vendor-supplied patch (but too late for inclusion in the release
      notes).  In &os; &release.current;, it has been fixed with the
      import of a new version of
      <application>sendmail</application>.</para>

    <para>A single-byte buffer overflow in &man.realpath.3; has been
      fixed.  See security advisory 
      <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:08.realpath.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:08</ulink>.</para>

    <para>A bug that could allow the kernel to attempt delivery of
      invalid signals has been fixed.  The bug could have led to a
      kernel panic.  For more information, see security advisory
      <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:09.signal.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:09</ulink>.</para>

    <para>A bug in the iBCS2 emulation module, which could result in
      disclosing the contents of kernel memory, has been fixed.  This
      module is not enabled in &os; by default.  For more information,
      see security advisory
      <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:10.ibcs2.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:10</ulink>.</para>

      <para arch="i386">A bug that even when no AT keyboard is connected,
        &man.atkbd.4; registers an AT keyboard during console initialization

        is no longer needed when only a USB keyboard is connected.</para>

      <para arch="i386">The &man.safe.4; driver has been added

      <para>&man.ipfw.4; rules now support comma-separated address lists
        (such as <literal>1.2.3.4, 5.6.7.8/30, 9.10.11.12/22</literal>),
        and allow spaces after commas to make lists of addresses more readable.</para>

      <para>&man.ipfw.4; rules now support C++-style comments.
        Each comment is stored together with its rule and appears using
        the &man.ipfw.8; <literal>show</literal> command.</para>

      <para>&man.ipfw.8; can now modify &man.ipfw.4; rules in set 31,
        which was read-only and used for the default rules.
        They can be deleted by <command>ipfw delete set 31</command>
        command but are not deleted
        by the <command>ipfw flush</command> command.

      <para>A new <literal>DIRECTIO</literal> kernel option enables
	support for read operations that bypass the buffer cache and
	put data directly into a userland buffer.  This feature
	requires that the <literal>O_DIRECT</literal> flag is set on
	the file descriptor and that both the offset and length for
	the read operation are multiples of the physical media sector
	size.</para>

    <para>&man.arp.8; now supports a <option>-i</option> option
      to limit the scope of the current operation to the ARP entries
      on a particular interface.  This option applies to the display
      operations only.  It should be useful on routers with numerous
      network interfaces.</para>

    <para>&man.chroot.8; now allows the optional setting of a user,
      primary group, or group list to use inside the chroot
      environment via the <option>-u</option>, <option>-g</option>,
      and <option>-G</option> options respectively.</para>

    <para>&man.ipfw.8; <literal>list</literal> and <literal>show</literal>
      command now support ranges of rule numbers.</para>

<sect1 id="upgrade">
  <title>Upgrading from previous releases of &os;</title>

  <para>If you're upgrading from a previous release of &os;, you
    generally will have three options:

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Using the binary upgrade option of &man.sysinstall.8;.
	  This option is perhaps the quickest, although it presumes
	  that your installation of &os; uses no special compilation
	  options.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>Performing a complete reinstall of &os;.  Technically,
	  this is not an upgrading method, and in any case is usually less
	  convenient than a binary upgrade, in that it requires you to
	  manually backup and restore the contents of
	  <filename>/etc</filename>.  However, it may be useful in
	  cases where you want (or need) to change the partitioning of
	  your disks.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>From source code in <filename>/usr/src</filename>.  This
	  route is more flexible, but requires more disk space, time,
	  and technical expertise.  More information can be found
	  in the <ulink
	  url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/makeworld.html"><quote>Using
	  <command>make world</command></quote></ulink> section of the <ulink
	  url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/">FreeBSD
	  Handbook</ulink>.  Upgrading from very old
	  versions of &os; may be problematic; in cases like this, it
	  is usually more effective to perform a binary upgrade or a
	  complete reinstall.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>Please read the <filename>INSTALL.TXT</filename> file for more
    information, preferably <emphasis>before</emphasis> beginning an
    upgrade.  If you are upgrading from source, please be sure to read
    <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename> as well.</para>

  <para>Finally, if you want to use one of various means to track the
    -STABLE or -CURRENT branches of &os;, please be sure to consult
    the <ulink
    url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/current-stable.html"><quote>-CURRENT
    vs. -STABLE</quote></ulink> section of the <ulink
    url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/">FreeBSD
    Handbook</ulink>.</para>

  <important>
    <para>Upgrading &os; should, of course, only be attempted after
      backing up <emphasis>all</emphasis> data and configuration
      files.</para>
