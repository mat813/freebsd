    <para>The release notes for &os; &release.current; contain a
      summary of the changes made to the &os; base system since
      &release.prev;.  Both changes for kernel and userland are
      listed, as well as applicable security advisories for the base
      system that were issued since the last release.  Some brief
      remarks on upgrading are also presented.</para>

  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current; on the &arch.print; hardware platform.  It
    describes new features of &os; that have been added (or changed)
    since &release.prev;.  It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents a point along the &release.branch; development
    branch between &release.prev; and the future &release.next;.  Some
    pre-built, binary &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

<![ %release.type.release [

  <para>This distribution of &os; &release.current; is a
    &release.type; distribution.  It can be found at <ulink

    information on obtaining this (or other) &release.type;
    distributions of &os; can be found in the <ulink

<!--
	The "What's New" section of the release notes. 

	Guidelines for new entries:

	1.  If there is some obvious "keyword" associated with an
	entry (such as a manpage entry or an application name), try to
	put it at the start of the sentence.

	2.  Within each subsection (i.e. kernel, security, userland),
	list items in alphabetical order by these keywords.

	Some entries will have no obvious keywords to help with
	ordering.  In sections containing these entries, put those
	containing (e.g.) manpage references first, then some
	suitable SGML comment line as a demarc, then the remaining
	entries.

  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
    features in &os; since &release.prev;.  Typical release note items
    document new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bugfixes, or contributed software upgrades.  Security
    advisories for the base system that were issued after
    &release.prev; are also listed.</para>

  <title>Upgrading from previous releases of &os;</title>

  <para>If you're upgrading from a previous release of &os;, you
    generally will have three options:

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Using the binary upgrade option of &man.sysinstall.8;.
	  This option is perhaps the quickest, although it presumes
	  that your installation of &os; uses no special compilation
	  options.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>Performing a complete reinstall of &os;.  Technically,
	  this is not an upgrading method, and in any case is usually less
	  convenient than a binary upgrade, in that it requires you to
	  manually backup and restore the contents of
	  <filename>/etc</filename>.  However, it may be useful in
	  cases where you want (or need) to change the partitioning of
	  your disks.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>From source code in <filename>/usr/src</filename>.  This
	  route is more flexible, but requires more disk space, time,
	  and technical expertise.  More information can be found
	  in the <ulink
	  url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/makeworld.html"><quote>Using
	  <command>make world</command></quote></ulink> section of the <ulink
	  url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/">FreeBSD
	  Handbook</ulink>.  Upgrading from very old
	  versions of &os; may be problematic; in cases like this, it
	  is usually more effective to perform a binary upgrade or a
	  complete reinstall.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>Please read the <filename>INSTALL.TXT</filename> file for more
    information, preferably <emphasis>before</emphasis> beginning an
    upgrade.  If you are upgrading from source, please be sure to read
    <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename> as well.</para>

  <para>Finally, if you want to use one of various means to track the
    -STABLE or -CURRENT branches of &os;, please be sure to consult
    the <ulink
    url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/current-stable.html"><quote>-CURRENT
    vs. -STABLE</quote></ulink> section of the <ulink
    url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/">FreeBSD
    Handbook</ulink>.</para>

  <important>
    <para>Upgrading &os; should, of course, only be attempted after
      backing up <emphasis>all</emphasis> data and configuration
      files.</para>
