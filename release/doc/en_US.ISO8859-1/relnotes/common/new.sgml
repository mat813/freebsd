<!--
	The "What's New" section of the release notes.  

	Guidelines for new entries:

	1.  If there is some obvious "keyword" associated with an
	entry (such as a manpage entry or an application name), try to
	put it at the start of the sentence.

	2.  Within each subsection (i.e. kernel, security, userland),
	list items in alphabetical order by these keywords.

  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
  features in &os; since &release.prev;.</para>

  <para>Many additional changes were made to &os; that are not listed
  here for lack of space.  For example, documentation was corrected
  and improved, minor bugs were fixed, insecure coding practices were
  audited and corrected, and source code was cleaned up.</para>

  <para>The release notes items are organized into three different
  sections.  <xref linkend="kernel"> lists recent changes to the &os;
  kernel.  Security fixes, including those pertaining to security
  advisories, are listed in <xref linkend="security">.  Finally, <xref
  linkend="userland"> covers changes to &os; userland applications
  included in the base system.</para>

  <sect2 id="kernel">
    <title>Kernel Changes</title>

    <para arch="i386">The load addresses of kernels has been exported
    to the symbol table and various hard-coded constants removed so
    that utilities such as &man.ps.1; can work with kernels compiled
    at different addresses.</para>

    <para>Coredumps of large processes (or of a large number of
    processes) no longer lock up the machine for long periods of
    time.</para>

    <para arch="i386">The number of memory pages allocated for the
    per-process kernel state has been increased from 2 to 3, to reduce
    the likelihood of kernel stack overflow (and subsequent corruption
    of per-process data structures).</para>
