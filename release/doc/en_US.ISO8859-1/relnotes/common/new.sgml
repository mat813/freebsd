  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current; on the &arch.print; hardware platform.  It
    describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
    It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

<![ %release.type.current [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents the latest point along the &release.branch; development
    branch since &release.branch; was created.  Information regarding pre-built, binary
    &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents a point along the &release.branch; development
    branch between &release.prev; and the future &release.next;.
    Information regarding
    pre-built, binary &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

]]>

<![ %release.type.release [

  <para>This distribution of &os; &release.current; is a
    &release.type; distribution.  It can be found at <ulink
    url="&release.url;"></ulink> or any of its mirrors.  More
    information on obtaining this (or other) &release.type;
    distributions of &os; can be found in the <ulink
    url="&url.books.handbook;/mirrors.html"><quote>Obtaining
    &os;</quote> appendix</ulink> to the <ulink
    url="&url.books.handbook;/">&os;
    Handbook</ulink>.</para>

]]>

  <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
    installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
    <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
    release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
    information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
    documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
    &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes
    the most user-visible new or changed features in &os;
    since &release.prev;.
  </para>

  <para>Typical release note items
    document recent security advisories issued after
    &release.prev;,
    new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades.  They may also
    list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
    practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot list every single
    change made to &os; between releases; this document focuses
    primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major
    architectural improvements.</para>

  <sect2 id="kernel">
    <title>Kernel Changes</title>

    <para>The opencrypto framework (&man.crypto.9;) and &man.ipsec.4;
      subsystem now support Camellia block cipher.</para>

    <para>The &os; kernel &man.malloc.9; now supports buffer corruption
      protection (RedZone).  This detects both buffer underflow and buffer
      overflow bugs at runtime on &man.free.9; and &man.realloc.9; and
      prints backtraces from where memory was allocated and from where it
      was freed.  For more details, see <literal>DEBUG_REDZONE</literal>
      kernel option.</para>

    <para>The client side functionality of &man.rpc.lockd.8; has been
      implemented in &os; kernel.  This implementation provides the
      correct semantics for &man.flock.2; style locks which are used
      by the &man.lockf.1; command line tool and the &man.pidfile.3;
      library.  It also implements recovery from server restarts and
      ensures that dirty cache blocks are written to the server before
      obtaining locks (allowing multiple clients to use file locking
      to safely share data).  Also, a new kernel option
      <literal>options NFSLOCKD</literal> has been added and enabled
      by default.  If the kernel support is enabled, &man.rpc.lockd.8;
      automatically detects and uses the functionality.</para>

    <!-- Above this line, sort kernel changes by manpage/keyword-->

    <sect3 id="boot">
      <title>Boot Loader Changes</title>

      <!-- Above this line, order boot loader changes by keyword-->

      <para>&os; now support booting from GPT-labeled disks from the BIOS.</para>

      <para arch="i386,amd64">The BTX kernel used by the boot
	loader has been changed to invoke BIOS routines from real
	mode.  This change makes it possible to boot &os; from USB
	devices.</para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="proc">
      <title>Hardware Support</title>

      <para>The &man.acpi.asus.4; driver now supports Asus EeePC backlight control.</para>

      <sect4 id="mm">
	<title>Multimedia Support</title>

	<para>The <filename>DRM</filename> driver now supports i915 GME device.</para>
      </sect4>

      <sect4 id="net-if">
	<title>Network Interface Support</title>

	<para>The &man.bge.4; driver now supports BCM5906-based adapters.</para>
      </sect4>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="net-proto">
      <title>Network Protocols</title>

      <para>The &man.dummynet.4; subsystem now supports
	<literal>fast</literal> mode operation which allows certain
	packets to bypass the dummynet scheduler.  This can achieve
	lower latency and lower overhead when the packet flow is under
	the pipe bandwidth, and eliminate recursion in the subsystem.
	The new sysctl variable
	<varname>net.inet.ip.dummynet.io_fast</varname> has been
	added to enable this feature.</para>

      <para>The &man.resolver.3; now allows underscore in domain
	names.  Although this is a violation of RFC 1034 [STD 13], it is
	accepted by certain name servers as well as other popular operating
	systems' resolver library.</para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="disks">
      <title>Disks and Storage</title>

      <para>The &man.aac.4; driver now supports 64-bit array support
	for RAIDs larger than 2TB and simultaneous opens of the device
	for issuing commands to the controller.</para>

      <para>A data corruption problem of the &man.ata.4; driver on
	ServerWorks HT1000 chipsets has been fixed.</para>

      <para>Stability of the &man.iir.4; driver has been improved.</para>

      <para>The &man.mpt.4; driver now supports <literal>mpt_user</literal>
	personality.</para>
    </sect3>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="userland">
    <title>Userland Changes</title>

    <para>The &man.bsdtar.1; utility now supports the following options:
      <option>--numeric-owner</option>, <option>-S</option>, and
      <option>-s</option>.</para>

    <para>A bug in &man.cp.1; utility which prevents POSIX.1e ACL (see
      also &man.acl.3;) from copying properly has been fixed.</para>

    <para>The &man.cron.8; utility now supports <option>-m</option> flag which
      overrides the default mail recipient for cron mails unless explicitly
      provided by <literal>MAILTO=</literal> line in <filename>crontab</filename>
      file.</para>

    <para>The &man.cvs.1; now supports <option>-n</option> flag which
      is the opposite of <option>-N</option> flag.</para>

    <para>The &man.dump.8; and &man.restore.8; utility now support
      extended attributes (see also &man.extattr.9;).</para>

    <para>The &man.fortune.6; program now supports
      <varname>FORTUNE_PATH</varname> environment variable to specify
      search path of the fortune files.</para>

    <para>A bug in the &man.fortune.6; program that prevents
      <option>-e</option> option with multiple files from working has
      been fixed.</para>

    <para>The &man.freebsd-update.conf.5; now supports
      <literal>IDSIgnorePaths</literal> statement.</para>

    <para>The &man.fwcontrol.8; utility now supports <option>-f
	<replaceable>node</replaceable></option> option which specifies
      <replaceable>node</replaceable> as the root node on the next bus
      reset.</para>

    <para>The &man.make.1; utility now supports <literal>:u</literal>
      variable modifier which removes adjacent duplicate words.</para>

    <para>The incorrect output grammer of &man.morse.6; program has
      been fixed.</para>

    <para>The &man.mountd.8; utility now supports <option>-h
	<replaceable>bindip</replaceable></option> option which
      specifies IP addresses to bind to for TCP and UDP requests.
      This option may be specified multiple times.  If no
      <option>-h</option> option is specified,
      <literal>INADDR_ANY</literal> will be used.  Note that when
      specifying IP addresses with this option, it will
      automatically add <literal>127.0.0.1</literal> and if IPv6 is
      enabled, <literal>::1</literal> to the list.</para>

    <para>The &man.moused.8; utility now supports <option>-L</option>
      flag which changes the speed of scrolling and changes

      directory to an existing directory across devices.</para>

    <para>The &man.periodic.8; now supports
      <varname>daily_status_mail_rejects_shorten</varname>
      configuration variable in &man.periodic.conf.5;.  This allows
      the rejected mail reports to tally the rejects per blacklist
      without providing details about individual sender hosts.  The
      default configuration keeps the reports in their original
      form.</para>

    <para>The &man.ping6.8; now uses exit status of
      <literal>0</literal> and <literal>2</literal> in the same manner
      as &man.ping.8;.</para>
