  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
  features in &os; since &release.prev;.</para>

  <para>Many additional changes were made to &os; that are not listed
  here for lack of space.  For example, documentation was corrected
  and improved, minor bugs were fixed, insecure coding practices were
  audited and corrected, and source code was cleaned up.</para>

  <para>The release notes items are organized into three different
  sections.  <xref linkend="kernel"> lists recent changes to the &os;
  kernel.  Security fixes, including those pertaining to security
  advisories, are listed in <xref linkend="security">.  Finally, <xref
  linkend="userland"> covers changes to &os; userland applications
  included in the base system.</para>
