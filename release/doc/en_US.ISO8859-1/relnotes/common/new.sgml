  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current; on the &arch.print; hardware platform.  It
    describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
    It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents a point along the &release.branch; development
    branch between &release.prev; and the future &release.next;.
    Information regarding

  <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
    installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
    <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
    release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
    information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
    documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
    &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes
    the most user-visible new or changed features in &os;
    since &release.prev;.
    In general, changes described here are unique to the &release.branch;
    branch unless specifically marked as &merged; features.
  </para>

  <para>Typical release note items
    document recent security advisories issued after
    &release.prev;,
    new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades.  They may also
    list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
    practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot list every single
    change made to &os; between releases; this document focuses
    primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major
    architectural improvements.</para>

    <title>Security Advisories</title>

    <para>A bug in the &man.fetch.1; utility, which allows
      a malicious HTTP server to cause arbitrary portions of the client's
      memory to be overwritten, has been fixed.
      For more information, see security advisory
      <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:16.fetch.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:16.fetch</ulink>.
      </para>

    <para>A bug in &man.procfs.5; and &man.linprocfs.5;
      which could allow a malicious local user to read parts of kernel
      memory or perform a local
      denial of service attack by causing a system panic,
      has been fixed.
      For more information, see security advisory
      <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:17.procfs.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:17.procfs</ulink>.
      </para>

    <para>Two buffer overflows in the TELNET client program have been
      corrected.  They could have allowed a malicious TELNET server or
      an active network attacker to cause &man.telnet.1; to execute
      arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running it.
      More information can be found in security advisory

      </para>

    <para>A information disclosure vulnerability in the
      &man.sendfile.2; system call, which could permit it to transmit
      random parts of kernel memory, has been fixed.  More details are
      in security advisory
      <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-05:02.sendfile.asc">FreeBSD-SA-05:02.sendfile</ulink>.
      </para>

    <para arch="amd64">A possible privilege escalation vulnerability on &os;/amd64
      has been fixed.  This allows unprivileged users to gain direct
      access to some hardware which cannot be accessed
      without the elevated privilege level.  More details are in security advisory
      <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-05:03.amd64.asc">FreeBSD-SA-05:03.amd64</ulink>.</para>

    <para>An information leak vulnerability in the
      <literal>SIOCGIFCONF</literal> &man.ioctl.2;, which leaked 12
      bytes of kernel memory, has been fixed.  More details are in security advisory
      <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-05:04.ifconf.asc">FreeBSD-SA-05:04.ifconf</ulink>.</para>

    <para>Several programming errors in &man.cvs.1;, which could
      potentially cause arbitrary code to be executed on CVS servers,
      have been corrected.  Further information can be found in
      security advisory
      <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-05:05.cvs.asc">FreeBSD-SA-05:05.cvs</ulink>.</para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="kernel">
    <title>Kernel Changes</title>

    <para>The &man.jail.8; feature now supports a new sysctl
      <varname>security.jail.chflags_allowed</varname>, which controls the
      behavior of &man.chflags.1; within a jail.
      If set to <literal>0</literal> (the default), then a jailed <username>root</username> user is
      treated as an unprivileged user; if set to <literal>1</literal>, then
      a jailed root user is treated the same as an unjailed <username>root</username> user.</para>

    <para arch="alpha,amd64,i386">The loader tunable <varname>debug.mpsafevm</varname>
      has been enabled by default.</para>

    <!-- Above this line, sort kernel changes by manpage/keyword-->

    <para>A number of bugs have been fixed in the ULE
      scheduler.</para>

    <para arch="i386">A bug in Inter-Processor Interrupt (IPI)
      handling, which could cause SMP systems to crash under heavy
      load, has been fixed.  More details are contained in errata note
      <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ERRATA/notices/FreeBSD-EN-05:03.ipi.asc">FreeBSD-EN-05:03.ipi</ulink>.
      </para>

    <para arch="i386">Memory allocation for legacy PCI bridges has
      been limited to the top 32MB of RAM.  Many older, legacy bridges
      only allow allocation from this range.  This change only applies
      to devices which don't have their memory assigned by the BIOS.
      This change fixes the <quote>bad Vcc</quote> error of CardBus
      bridges (&man.pccbb.4;).</para>

      <para arch="sparc64">The &man.uart.4; driver is now enabled in
	the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel, and is now the
	default driver for serial ports.  The ofw_console,
	&man.sab.4;, and zs drivers are now disabled in the
	<filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.</para>

      <sect4 id="mm">
	<title>Multimedia Support</title>

	<para arch="sparc64">The &man.snd.audiocs.4; driver has been
	  added to support the Crystal Semiconductor CS4231 audio
	  controller found on &ultrasparc; workstations.</para>

      </sect4>

      <sect4 id="net-if">
	<title>Network Interface Support</title>

	<para>The &man.cdce.4; USB Communication Device Class Ethernet
	  driver has been added.</para>

	<para>The &man.cp.4; driver is now MPSAFE.</para>

	<para>The &man.ctau.4; driver is now MPSAFE.</para>

	<para>The &man.cx.4; driver is now MPSAFE.</para>

	<para>The &man.ed.4; driver now supports the &man.altq.4;
	  framework.</para>

	<para>In the &man.em.4; driver, hardware support for VLAN
	  tagging is now disabled by default due to some interactions
	  between this feature and promiscuous mode.</para>

	<para>Ethernet flow control is now disabled by default in the
	  &man.fxp.4; driver, to prevent problems with a system panics
	  or is left in the kernel debugger.</para>

	<para>The &man.hme.4; driver is now MPSAFE.</para>

	  framework.</para>

	<para>The &man.sf.4; driver now has support for device polling
	  and &man.altq.4;.</para>

	<para>Several programming errors in the &man.sk.4; driver have
	  been corrected.  These bugs were particular to SMP systems, and
	  could cause panics, page faults, aborted SSH connections, or
	  corrupted file transfers.  More details can be found in
	  errata note
	  <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ERRATA/notices/FreeBSD-EN-05:02.sk.asc">FreeBSD-EN-05:02.sk</ulink>.

    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="net-proto">
      <title>Network Protocols</title>

      <para>The MTU feedback in IPv6 has been disabled when the sender writes
	data that must be fragmented.</para>

      <para>The Common Address Redundancy Protocol (CARP) has
	been implemented.  CARP comes from OpenBSD and allows
	multiple hosts to share an IP address, providing
	high availability and load balancing.
	For more information, see the &man.carp.4; manual page.</para>

      <para>The &man.ipfw.4; system can work with
	<varname>debug.mpsafenet</varname>=<literal>1</literal>
	(this tunable is <literal>1</literal> by default)
	when the <literal>gid</literal>, <literal>jail</literal>,
	and/or <literal>uid</literal> rule options are used.</para>

      <para>The &man.ipfw.8; <literal>ipfw fwd</literal> rule now supports
	the full packet destination manipulation when the kernel option
	<literal>options IPFIREWALL_FORWARD_EXTENDED</literal> is specified
	in addition to <literal>options IPFIRWALL_FORWARD</literal>.
	This kernel option disables all restrictions to ensure proper
	behavior for locally generated packets and allows redirection of
	packets destined to locally configured IP addresses.
	Note that &man.ipfw.8; rules have to be carefully crafted to
	make sure that things like PMTU discovery do not break.</para>

      <para>&man.ipnat.8; now allows redirect rules to
	work for non-TCP/UDP packets.</para>

      <para>Ongoing work is reducing the use of the Giant lock by the
	network protocol stack and improving the locking
	strategies.</para>

      <para>A new &man.ng.netflow.4; NetGraph node allows a router
	running &os; to do NetFlow version 5 exports.</para>

      <para>The &man.sppp.4; driver now includes Frame Relay
	support.</para>

      <para>A bug in TCP that sometimes caused RST packets to
	be ignored if the receive window was zero bytes has been
	fixed.</para>

      <para>Several bugs in the TCP SACK implementation have been
	fixed.</para>

      <para>The KAME IPv4 IPsec implementation integrated
	in &os; now supports TCP-MD5.</para>

      <para>Random ephemeral port number allocation has led to some
        problems with port reuse at high connection rates.  This
        feature is now disabled during periods of high connection
        rates; whenever new connections are created faster than
        <varname>net.inet.ip.portrange.randomcps</varname> per second,
        port number randomization is disabled for the next
        <varname>net.inet.ip.portrange.randomtime</varname>
        seconds.  The default values for these two sysctl variables
        are <literal>10</literal> and <literal>45</literal>,
        respectively.</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="disks">
      <title>Disks and Storage</title>

      <para>The &man.amr.4; driver is now safe for use on systems
	using &man.pae.4;.</para>

      <para arch="i386,ia64">The &man.arcmsr.4; driver has been added.
	It supports the Areca ARC-11<replaceable>xx</replaceable> and
	ARC-12<replaceable>xx</replaceable> series of SATA RAID
	controllers.</para>

      <para>The &man.hptmv.4; driver, which supports the HighPoint
	RocketRAID 182x series, has been added.</para>

      <para>The &man.ips.4; driver now support kernel crash dumps
	on some modern ServeRAID models.</para>

      <para>The &man.matcd.4; driver has been removed.</para>

      <para>The SHSEC GEOM class has been added.  It provides for the
	sharing of a secret between multiple GEOM providers.  All of
	these providers must be present in order to reveal the
	secret.  This feature is controlled by the &man.gshsec.8;
	utility.</para>

      <para>Information about newly-mounted cd9660 file systems (such
	as the presence of Rockridge extensions) is now only printed
	if the kernel was booted in verbose mode.  This change was
	made to reduce the amount of (generally unnecessary) kernel
	log messages.</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="fs">
      <title>File Systems</title>

      <para>Recomputing the summary information for
	<quote>dirty</quote> UFS and UFS2 file systems is no longer
	done at mount time, but is now done by background
	&man.fsck.8;.  This change improves the startup speed when
	mounting large file systems after a crash.  The prior behavior
	can be restored by setting the
	<varname>vfs.ffs.compute_summary_at_mount</varname> sysctl
	variable to a non-zero value.</para>

      <para>A kernel panic in the NFS server has been fixed.  More

    </sect3>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="userland">
    <title>Userland Changes</title>

    <para>The &man.ftpd.8; program now uses the <literal>212</literal>
      and <literal>213</literal> status codes for directory
      and file status correctly (<literal>211</literal> was used in
      the previous versions).  This behavior is described in RFC 959.
      </para>

    <para>The &man.getaddrinfo.3; function now queries <literal>A</literal>
      DNS resource records before <literal>AAAA</literal> records
      when <literal>AF_UNSPEC</literal> is specified.
      Some broken DNS servers return <literal>NXDOMAIN</literal>
      against non-existent <literal>AAAA</literal> queries,
      even when it should return <literal>NOERROR</literal>
      with empty return records.  This is a problem for an IPv4/IPv6 dual
      stack node because the <literal>NXDOMAIN</literal> returned
      by the first query of an <literal>AAAA</literal> record makes
      the querying server stop attempting to resolve the <literal>A</literal>
      record if any.  Also, this behavior has been recognized as a potential
      denial-of-service attack (see <ulink url="http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/714121"></ulink>
      for more details).
      Note that although the query order has been changed,
      the returned result still includes
      <literal>AF_INET6</literal> records before
      <literal>AF_INET</literal> records.</para>

    <para>The <literal>create</literal> command of the &man.gpt.8;
      utility now supports a <option>-f</option> command-line flag to
      force creation of a GPT even when there is an MBR record on a
      disk.</para>

    <para>The gvinum(8) utility now supports
      <command>checkparity</command>,
      <command>rebuildparity</command>, and
      <command>setstate</command>
      subcommands.</para>

    <para>The <filename>libarchive</filename> library (as well as the
      &man.tar.1; command that uses it) now has support for reading ISO
      images (with optional RockRidge extensions) and ZIP archives
      (with <literal>deflate</literal> and <literal>none</literal>
      compression).</para>

    <para>The <filename>libgpib</filename> library has been added to
      give userland access to GPIB devices (using the the pcii driver)
      via the
      <function>ib<replaceable>foo</replaceable></function>
      API.</para>

    <para>A number of bugfixes for <filename>libpthread</filename>
      have been merged from HEAD.</para>

    <para>A number of new functions have been implemented in the
      &man.math.3; library.  These include &man.ceill.3;,
      &man.floorl.3;, &man.ilogbl.3;, &man.fma.3; and variants,
      &man.lrint.3; and variants, and &man.lround.3; and
      variants.</para>

    <para arch="i386">The &man.mkuzip.8; utility, which
      compresses file system images for use with
      <literal>GEOM_UZIP</literal> &man.geom.4; module,
      has been added. &merged;</para>

    <para>The &man.moused.8; daemon now supports <quote>virtual
      scrolling</quote>, in which mouse motions made while holding
      down the middle mouse button are interpreted as scrolling.  This
      feature is enabled with the <option>-V</option>
      flag.</para>

    <para>A separate directory has been added for &man.named.8;
      dynamic zones which is owned by the <username>bind</username> user
      (for creation of the zone journal file).
      For more detail, see an example dynamic zone in the sample
      &man.named.conf.5;.</para>

    <para>The &man.newfs.8; utility now supports a <option>-n</option>
      flag to suppress the creation of a <filename>.snap</filename>
      directory on new file systems.  This feature is intended for use
      on memory or vnode file systems that will not require snapshot
      support.</para>

    <para>The &man.newfs.8; utility now emits a warning when creating
      a UFS or UFS2 file system that cannot support snapshots.  This
      situation can occur in the case of very large file systems with
      small block sizes.</para>

    <para>The <literal>NO_NIS</literal> compile-time knob for userland
      has been added.  As its name implies, enabling this
      <filename>Makefile</filename> variable will cause NIS support to
      be excluded from various programs and will cause the NIS
      utilities to not be built.</para>

    <para>The &man.ncal.1; utility now supports a <option>-m</option>
      flag to generate a calendar for a specified month in the current
      year.</para>

    <para>The &man.periodic.8; security output now supports the display of
      information about blocked packet counts from &man.pf.4;.</para>

    <para>The &man.ppp.8; program now implements an
      <option>echo</option> parameter, which allows LCP ECHOs to be
      enabled independently of LQR reports.  Older versions of
      &man.ppp.8; would revert to LCP ECHO mode on negotiation
      failure.  It is now necessary to specify <command>enable
      echo</command> to get this behavior.</para>

    <para>Two bugs in the &man.pppd.8; program have been fixed.
      They may result in an incorrect CBCP response,
      which violates the Microsoft PPP Callback Control Protocol
      section 3.2.</para>

    <para>The &man.restore.8; utility has regained the ability to read
      &os; version 1 dump tapes.</para>

    <para>The &man.rm.1; utility now supports an <option>-I</option>
      option that asks for confirmation (once) if recursively
      removing directories or if more than 3 files are listed in the
      command line.</para>

    <para>The &man.rtld.1; dynamic linker now supports specifying
      library replacements via the <varname>LD_LIBMAP</varname>
      environment variable.  This variable will override the entries
      in &man.libmap.conf.5;.</para>

    <para>The &man.strftime.3; function now supports some GNU extensions
      such as <literal>-</literal> (no padding),
      <literal>_</literal> (use space as padding),
      and <literal>0</literal> (zero padding).</para>

    <para>The &man.syslog.3; function is now thread-safe.</para>

    <para>The &man.syslogd.8; utility now opens an additional domain
      socket (<filename>/var/run/logpriv</filename> by default),
      with <literal>0600</literal> permissions to be used
      by privileged programs.  This prevents privileged
      programs from locking when the domain sockets
      run out of buffer space due to a
      local denial-of-service attack.</para>

    <para>The &man.syslogd.8; utility now allows
      <literal>:</literal> and <literal>%</literal>
      characters in the hostname specifications.
      These characters are used in IPv6 addresses and scope IDs.</para>

    <para>The &man.systat.1; <option>-netstat</option> display is now
      IPv6-aware.<para>

    <para>The <option>-f</option> option of &man.tail.1; utility
      now supports more than one file at a time.</para>

    <para>The &man.tcpdrop.8; command, which closes a selected TCP
      connection, has been added.  It was obtained from
      OpenBSD.</para>

    <para>In prior &os; releases, the <filename>disc1</filename>
      CD-ROM (or ISO image) was a bootable installation disk
      containing the base system, ports tree, and common packages.
      The <filename>disc2</filename> CD-ROM (or ISO image) was a
      bootable <quote>fix it</quote> disk with a live filesystem, to
      be used for making emergency repairs.  This layout has now
      changed.  For all architectures except ia64, the
      <filename>disc1</filename> image now contains the base system
      distribution files, ports tree, and the live filesystem, making
      it suitable for both an initial installation and repair
      purposes.  (On the ia64, the live filesystem is on a separate
      disk due to its size.)  Packages appear on separate
      disks; in particular, the <filename>disc2</filename> image
      contains commonly packages such as desktop environments.
      Documents from the &os; Documentation Project also appear on
      <filename>disc2</filename>.</para>
