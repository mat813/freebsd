  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes
    the most user-visible new or changed features in &os;
    since &release.prev;.
  </para>

  <para>Typical release note items
    document recent security advisories issued after
    &release.prev;,
    new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bug fixes, or contributed software upgrades.  They may also
    list changes to major ports/packages or release engineering
    practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot list every single
    change made to &os; between releases; this document focuses
    primarily on security advisories, user-visible changes, and major
    architectural improvements.</para>

  <sect2 id="kernel">
    <title>Kernel Changes</title>

    <para>Security event auditing is now supported in the &os; kernel,
      and is enabled by the <literal>AUDIT</literal> kernel
      configuration option.  More information can be found in the
      &man.audit.4; manual page.</para>

    <para arch="amd64,i386">Instead of including all of physical
      memory in a kernel crash dump, the kernel now defaults to
      dumping only pages that are actively mapped into kernel virtual
      memory.  This functionality requires that the new
      <varname>debug.minidump</varname> sysctl variable be set to
      <literal>1</literal>.</para>

    <para>Several workarounds for bugs in the &man.tty.4; layer have
      been added; these changes prevent a variety of observed kernel
      panics.</para>

    <para>A bug has been fixed in the statistics-keeping code in the
      kernel's UMA memory allocator.  This caused a count of memory
      allocation failures (as shown by <command>netstat -m</command>)
      to increase erroneously.</para>

    <para>&os; now runs on the Xbox, whose architecture is nearly identical
      to the i386.  For details of the latest development, see
      <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/platforms/xbox.html"></ulink>.

    <sect3 id="boot">
      <title>Boot Loader Changes</title>

      <!-- Above this line, order boot loader changes by keyword-->

      <para arch="pc98">A bootable CDROM loader has been implemented
	for the pc98 platform.</para>

      <para arch="i386">A bug in the i386 boot loader, which could
	cause filesystem corruption if
	a <filename>nextboot.conf</filename> file was used and landed
	after cylinder 1023, has been fixed.</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="proc">
      <title>Hardware Support</title>

      <para>The &man.amdsmb.4; driver has been added.  It provides
	support for the AMD-8111 SMBus 2.0 controller.</para>

      <para arch="i386">Support has been improved for
	so-called <quote>legacy-free</quote> hardware, in particular,
	i386 systems without AT-style keyboard controllers such as the
	Macbook Pro.</para>

      <para arch="i386,amd64">&man.ipmi.4;, an OpenIPMI compatible driver,
	has been added.
	OpenIPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) is an open
	standard designed to enable remote monitoring and control of server,
	networking and telecommunication platforms.</para>

      <para>Support for the PadLock Security Co-processor in VIA C3,
	Eden, and C7
	processors has been added to the &man.crypto.9; subsystem.
	More information can be found in the &man.padlock.4; manual
	page.</para>

      <para>The &man.nfsmb.4; driver, which supports the NVIDIA nForce
	2/3/4 SMBus 2.0 controller, has been added.</para>

	<title>Multimedia Support</title>

	<para></para>
      </sect4>

      <sect4 id="net-if">
	<title>Network Interface Support</title>

	<para>The &man.ath.4; driver has been updated to
	  HAL version 0.9.17.2.</para>

	<para arch="alpha,amd64,i386,sparc64">The &man.ath.4;, &man.ath.hal.4;, and
	  <literal>ath_rate_sample</literal> drivers have been
	  included in the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel by
	  default.</para>

	<para>Some improvements have been made to the &man.bce.4;
	  driver to improve its stability.  One user-visible aspect of
	  these changes is that transmit-side checksum offload
	  involving IP fragments has been disabled, because it was not
	  handled correctly by the hardware.</para>

	<para>The &man.em.4; driver has been updated to version 6.2.9
	  from Intel.  Among other changes, it adds support for a
	  number of new adapters.  Compiling the driver with
	  the <literal>EM_FAST_INTR</literal> preprocesor symbol
	  defined will enable optional <quote>fast interrupt</quote>
	  processing.  <quote>Fast interrupt</quote> processing, as
	  implemented in this version of the driver, has been shown to
	  yield significant performance improvements in some cases,
	  but has been linked to stability issues in other
	  cases.</para>

	<para>A number of improvements and bugfixes have been made to the
	  functionality of the &man.iwi.4; driver.  This driver now
	  requires the firmware image in the 
	  <filename role="package">net/iwi-firmware-kmod</filename>
	  port/package; prior versions of this driver used the
	  <filename role="package">net/iwi-firmware</filename>
	  port/package.</para>

	<para>The &man.my.4; driver now has &man.altq.4; support.</para>

	<para>The &man.nve.4; driver has been updated to version 1.0-0310
	  (23-Nov-2005).  It also now has &man.altq.4; support.</para>

	<para>The &man.sk.4; driver is now MPSAFE.</para>

	<para>The &man.stge.4; driver has been added.  It supports the
	  Sundance/Tamarack TC9021 Gigabit Ethernet controller and was
	  ported from NetBSD.</para>
      </sect4>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="net-proto">
      <title>Network Protocols</title>

      <para>Multiple copies of a packet received via different
        &man.bpf.4; listeners now all have identical
        timestamps.</para>

      <para>The &man.enc.4; IPsec filtering pseudo-device has been
	added.  It allows firewall packages using the &man.pfil.9;
	framework to examine (and filter) IPsec traffic before
	outbound encryption and after inbound decryption.</para>

      <para>The sysctl variables <varname>net.inet.ip.portrange.reservedhigh</varname>
	and <varname>net.inet.ip.portrange.reservedlow</varname>
	can be used with IPv6 now.</para>

      <para>The <literal>IPFIREWALL_FORWARD_EXTENDED</literal> kernel
	option has been removed.  This option was used to permit
	&man.ipfw.4; to redirect packets with local destinations.
	This behavior is now always enabled when
	the <literal>IPFIREWALL_FORWARD</literal> kernel option is
	enabled.</para>

      <para>The &man.ipfw.4; packet filter now supports
	<literal>tag</literal> and <literal>untag</literal> rule keywords.
	When a packet matches a rule with the <literal>tag</literal>
	keyword, the numeric tag for the given number in the range
	from 0 to 65535 will be attached to the packet.
	The tag acts as an internal marker (it is not sent out over
	the wire) that can be used to identify these packets later on,
	for example, by using <literal>tagged</literal>
	rule option.  For more details, see &man.ipfw.8;.</para>

      <para>The &man.ng.ether.4; Netgraph node no longer overwrites
        the MAC address of outgoing frames by default.</para>

      <para>The &man.ng.tag.4; Netgraph node has been added to
        support the manipulation of mbuf tags attached to data in the
        kernel.</para>

      <para>Support for &man.kqueue.2; operations has been added to
	the &man.tun.4; driver.</para>

      <para>&os; &release.prev; contained a bug in the IPv6
	implementation, which caused spurious error messages to be
	printed for point-to-point interfaces.  This problem has been
	corrected.</para>

      <para>IPv6 link-local addresses are now enabled only
	if <varname>ipv6_enable</varname> is set in &man.rc.conf.5;.</para>

      <para>A bug that prevented &man.carp.4; from working correctly
	in some IPv6 environments has been fixed.</para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="disks">
      <title>Disks and Storage</title>

      <para>The &man.arcmsr.4; driver has been updated to version
	1.20.00.13.</para>

      <para>The &man.ata.4; driver now supports USB mass storage class
	devices.  To enable it, a line <literal>device atausb</literal>
	in the kernel configuration file or loading the
	<filename>atausb</filename> kernel module is needed.
	Note that this functionality cannot coexist with the
	&man.umass.4; driver.</para>

      <para>The &man.ata.4; driver has been updated to reflect the
        version in &os; CURRENT.</para>

      <para>&man.geli.8; is now able to perform data integrity
        verification (data authentication) of encrypted data stored on
        disk.  Note that the encryption algorithm is now specified to
        the &man.geli.8; control program using the <option>-e</option>
        option; the <option>-a</option> option is now used to specify
        the authentication algorithm.</para>

      <para>The &man.isp.4; driver has been updated to reflect the
        version in &os; CURRENT.</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="fs">
      <title>File Systems</title>

      <para>Several bugs related to locking have been fixed in
	&man.devfs.5;.  These fixes prevent several observed deadlock
	conditions.</para>

      <para>The &man.linsysfs.5; pseudo-filesystem driver has been
	added.  It provides a subset of the
	Linux <filename>sys</filename> filesystem, and is required for
	the correct operation of some Linux binaries (such as the LSI
	MegaRAID SAS utility).</para>

      <para>A deadlock observed when both quotas and snapshots were in
	use on a file system on &os; &release.prev; has been
	corrected.</para>

      <para>A performance regression with NFS servers running &os;
	&release.prev;, caused by a leak of the Giant kernel lock, has
	been fixed.</para>
