  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current; on the &arch.print; hardware platform.  It
    describes new features of &os; that have been added (or changed)
    since &release.prev;.  It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents a point along the &release.branch; development
    branch between &release.prev; and the future &release.next;.  Some
    pre-built, binary &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

<!--
	The "What's New" section of the release notes. 

	Guidelines for new entries:

	1.  If there is some obvious "keyword" associated with an
	entry (such as a manpage entry or an application name), try to
	put it at the start of the sentence.

	2.  Within each subsection (i.e. kernel, security, userland),
	list items in alphabetical order by these keywords.

	Some entries will have no obvious keywords to help with
	ordering.  In sections containing these entries, put those
	containing (e.g.) manpage references first, then some
	suitable SGML comment line as a demarc, then the remaining
	entries.

<sect1 id="new">
  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
    features in &os; since &release.prev;.  Typical release note items
    document new drivers or hardware support, new commands or options,
    major bugfixes, or contributed software upgrades.  Security
    advisories for the base system that were issued after
    &release.prev; are also listed.</para>

  <sect2 id="security">
    <title>Security Advisories</title>

    <para>A potential denial of service in
      <application>BIND</application> has been fixed.  For more
      information, see security advisory
      <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:19.bind.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:19</ulink>.</para>

    <para>A bug with the System V Shared Memory interface
      (specifically the &man.shmat.2; system call) has been fixed.
      This bug can cause a shared memory segment to reference
      unallocated kernel memory.  In turn, this can permit a local
      attacker to gain unauthorized access to parts of kernel memory,
      possibly resulting in disclosure of sensitive information,
      bypass of access control mechanisms, or privilege escalation.
      More details can be found in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:02.shmat.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:02</ulink>.
      </para>

    <para>A potential low-bandwidth denial-of-service attack against
      the &os; TCP stack has been prevented by limiting the number of
      out-of-sequence TCP segments that can be held at one time.  More
      details can be found in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:04.tcp.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:04</ulink>.
      </para>

    <para>A bug in <application>OpenSSL</application>'s SSL/TLS
      ChangeCipherSpec message processing could result in
      a null pointer dereference, has been fixed.
      This could allow a remote attacker to crash an
      <application>OpenSSL</application>-using
      application and cause a denial-of-service on the system.
      More details can be found in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:05.openssl.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:05</ulink>.</para>

    <para>Two programming errors in <application>CVS</application>
      have been fixed.  They allow a server to overwrite arbitrary
      files on the client, and a client to read arbitrary files
      on the server when accessing remote CVS repositories.
      More details can be found in security advisory <ulink

      the NAT gateway is not supported.</para>

    <para arch="i386"><filename>libdisk</filename> now uses the
      correct PC98 disk partition value for &os;.  This permits the
      &man.sysinstall.8; disk partition editor to correctly create a
      single &os; partition covering the entire disk.</para>

    <para>&man.makewhatis.1;, formerly a Perl script, has been

    <title>Ports/Packages Collection Infrastructure</title>

    <para>The <literal>SIZE</literal> attribute for distfiles,
      which can be used for checking file sizes before fetching,
      has been added and enabled by default.
      <varname>DISABLE_SIZE</varname> is a user control knob
      to disable the distfile size checking.  This is especially
      useful on old &os; versions which didn't have &man.fetch.1;
      support for this, and for some FTP proxies which always
      report incorrect or bogus sizes.</para>

    <para>Two new files have been added to the ports tree to track
      note-worthy changes:  <filename>ports/CHANGES</filename> lists
      major changes to the Ports Collection and its infrastructure.
      <filename>ports/UPDATING</filename> describes some potential

    <title>Release Engineering and Integration</title>

    <para>The supported release of <application>GNOME</application>
      has been updated from 2.4 to 2.6.

      <note>
	<para>If you are using the older <application>GNOME</application>
	  desktop itself (<filename role="package">x11/gnome2</filename>), simply upgrading it from the &os; Ports Collection
	  with
	  &man.portupgrade.1;
	  (<filename role="package">sysutils/portupgrade</filename>)
	  will cause serious problems.
	  If you are a <application>GNOME</application> desktop user,
	  please read the instructions carefully at
	  <ulink url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/gnome/docs/faq26.html"></ulink>,
	  and use the <filename>gnome_upgrade.sh</filename> script to
	  properly upgrade to <application>GNOME</application> 2.6.</para>

	<para>Note that if you are just a casual user of some of the
	  <application>GNOME</application> libraries,
	  &man.portupgrade.1; should be sufficient
	  to update your ports.</para>
      </note>

<sect1 id="upgrade">
  <title>Upgrading from previous releases of &os;</title>

  <para>If you're upgrading from a previous release of &os;, you
    generally will have three options:

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Using the binary upgrade option of &man.sysinstall.8;.
	  This option is perhaps the quickest, although it presumes
	  that your installation of &os; uses no special compilation
	  options.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>Performing a complete reinstall of &os;.  Technically,
	  this is not an upgrading method, and in any case is usually less
	  convenient than a binary upgrade, in that it requires you to
	  manually backup and restore the contents of
	  <filename>/etc</filename>.  However, it may be useful in
	  cases where you want (or need) to change the partitioning of
	  your disks.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>From source code in <filename>/usr/src</filename>.  This
	  route is more flexible, but requires more disk space, time,
	  and technical expertise.  More information can be found
	  in the <ulink
	  url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/makeworld.html"><quote>Using
	  <command>make world</command></quote></ulink> section of the <ulink
	  url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/">FreeBSD
	  Handbook</ulink>.  Upgrading from very old
	  versions of &os; may be problematic; in cases like this, it
	  is usually more effective to perform a binary upgrade or a
	  complete reinstall.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>Please read the <filename>INSTALL.TXT</filename> file for more
    information, preferably <emphasis>before</emphasis> beginning an
    upgrade.  If you are upgrading from source, please be sure to read
    <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename> as well.</para>

  <para>Finally, if you want to use one of various means to track the
    -STABLE or -CURRENT branches of &os;, please be sure to consult
    the <ulink
    url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/current-stable.html"><quote>-CURRENT
    vs. -STABLE</quote></ulink> section of the <ulink
    url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/">FreeBSD
    Handbook</ulink>.</para>

  <important>
    <para>Upgrading &os; should, of course, only be attempted after
      backing up <emphasis>all</emphasis> data and configuration
      files.</para>
