  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
  features in &os; since &release.prev;.</para>

  <para>Many additional changes were made to &os; that are not listed
  here for lack of space.  For example, documentation was corrected
  and improved, minor bugs were fixed, insecure coding practices were
  audited and corrected, and source code was cleaned up.</para>

  <para>The release notes items are organized into three different
  sections.  <xref linkend="kernel"> lists recent changes to the &os;
  kernel.  Security fixes, including those pertaining to security
  advisories, are listed in <xref linkend="security">.  Finally, <xref
  linkend="userland"> covers changes to &os; userland applications
  included in the base system.</para>

  <sect2 id="kernel">
    <title>Kernel Changes</title>

    <para>The <literal>O_DIRECT</literal> flag has been added to
    &man.open.2; and &man.fcntl.2;.  Specifying this flag for open
    files will attempt to minimize the cache effects of reading and
    writing.</para>

    <para>An &man.orm.4; device has been added to claim the option
    ROMs in the ISA memory I/O space, to prevent other drivers from
    mistakenly assigning addresses that conflict with these ROMs.</para>

    <para>The out-of-swap process termination code now begins killing
    processes earlier to avoid deadlocks; it now also takes into
    account the swap space used by processes when computing the
    process sizes.</para>

    <para>Network device cloning has been implemented, and the &man.gif.4;
    device has been modified to take advantage of it.
    Thus, instead of specifying how many &man.gif.4; interfaces
    are available in kernel configuration files, &man.ifconfig.8;'s
    <option>create</option> option should be used when another device
    instance is desired.</para>

    <para>Two new &man.ddb.4; commands, <command>hwatch</command> and
    <command>dhwatch</command>, have been introduced.  Analogous to
    <command>watch</command> and <command>dwatch</command>, they install
    hardware watchpoints (as opposed to software watchpoints) if supported
    by the architecture.</para>

    <para>A &man.nmdm.4; null-modem terminal driver has been added.</para>

    <para>The &man.stl.4; driver now supports the PCI and ISA EasyIO
    multi-port serial cards from Stallion Technologies based on the
    Signetics SC26C194/8 Intelligent Quad/Octal UART.</para>

    <para>The <varname>maxusers</varname> kernel configuration
    parameter is now a boot-time tunable variable.  The kernel
    parameters derived from <varname>maxusers</varname> are now also
    tunables and can be overridden at boot-time.  The
    <varname>hz</varname> parameter is also now a tunable.</para>

    <para arch="i386">The &os; boot loader now contains a workaround
    to support CDROM booting on certain IBM BIOSs that expect the
    first sector of the emulated floppy to contain a valid MS-DOS BPB
    that they can modify.</para>

    <para arch="alpha">A long standing bug in the &os; boot from CDROM has 
    been fixed.  This means that machines like the AlphaServer 1200 can now
    be booted from the installation and fixit CDROMs.</para>
    
    <para arch="alpha">Whitebox (NT-only) AlphaServer 530x machines are
    now supported by &os;.  &os; is as always booted from SRM, not from
    AlphaBIOS.</para>

    <para>On many modern hosts, PCCARD devices can be configured to
    route their interrupts via either the ISA or PCI interrupt paths.
    The &man.pcic.4; driver has been updated to support both interrupt
    paths (formerly, only routing via ISA was supported).  In most
    cases, configuration of PCMCIA devices in laptops is simpler and
    more flexible.  In addition, various Cardbus bridge PCI cards
    (such as those used by Orinoco PCI NICs) are now supported.  Some
    hosts may experience problems, such as hangs or panics, with PCI
    interrupt routing; they can frequently be made to work by forcing
    the older-style ISA interrupt routing.  The following lines,
    placed in <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>, may fix the 
    problem:</para>

    <programlisting>hw.pcic.intr_path="1"
hw.pcic.irq="0"</programlisting>

    <para>When installing &os; on such a system, typing the following
    lines to the boot loader may be helpful in starting up &os; for
    the first time:<para>

    <screen><prompt>ok</prompt> <userinput>set hw.pcic.intr_path="1"</userinput>
<prompt>ok</prompt> <userinput>set hw.pcic.irq="0"</userinput></screen>

    <sect3>
      <title>Processor/Motherboard Support</title>

      <para arch="i386">Detection for new processors, such as the
      Transmeta Crusoe, and Transmeta Crusoe with LongRun, has been
      added.</para>

      <para arch="alpha">Because of space constraints on the boot floppy,
      support for DEC3000 TurboChannel-based machines has been removed from
      the installation kernel.  For the same reason, the following device 
      drivers are no longer present in the installation kernel: 
      &man.ncr.4;, &man.sa.4;, &man.amr.4;, &man.plip.4;, &man.le.4;, &man.pcn.4;, &man.wx.4;, and &man.sl.4;.  Note that most if not
      all Symbios adapters are covered by the new &man.sym.4; driver.</para>

      <para arch="i386">Support for Streaming <acronym>SIMD</acronym>
      Extensions (<acronym>SSE</acronym>) has been introduced.  The
      <literal>CPU_ENABLE_SSE</literal> kernel option controls whether
      support is compiled into the kernel.</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Network Interface Support</title>

      <para>The &man.fxp.4; driver now requires a <literal>device
      miibus</literal> entry in the kernel configuration file.</para>

      <para>The &man.wx.4; driver now supports the Intel PRO1000-F and
      PRO1000-T (10/100/1000) adapters.</para>
      
      <para>The &man.an.4; driver now supports the Cisco Aironet 350
      series of adaptors and has received a few bug fixes;
      promiscuous mode now works, and it can be configured before being
      brought <literal>up</literal>.</para>

      <para>The &man.xl.4; driver now supports reception of VLAN
      tagged frames (on the <quote>Cyclone</quote> or newer
      chipsets).</para>

      <para>The &man.ti.4; driver correctly masks VLAN tags.</para>

      <para>Added the &man.nge.4; driver, which supports PCI Gigabit
      Ethernet adapters based on the National Semiconductor DP83820
      and DP83821 Gigabit Ethernet controller chips, including the
      D-Link DGE-500T, SMC EZ Card 1000 (SMC9462TX), Asante
      FriendlyNet GigaNIC 1000TA and 1000TPC and Addtron
      AEG320T.  This driver supports transmit and receive checksum
      offloading.</para>

      <para>The &man.lge.4; driver has been added to support the Level
      1 LXT1001 NetCellerator Gigabit Ethernet controller chip. This
      device is used on some fiber optic GigE cards from SMC, D-Link
      and Addtron.  Jumbograms and TCP/IP checksum offload on receive
      are supported, although hardware VLAN filtering is not.</para>

      <para>The &man.tx.4; driver now supports the fiber-optic
      SMC 9432FTX NICs.</para>

      <para>The &man.ed.4; driver now has support for D-Link
      DL10022 chips, necessary for the NetGear FA-410TX and other
      cards.  As a result, <literal>device miibus</literal> is
      required in kernel configurations using the &man.ed.4;
      driver.</para>

      <para>The &man.txp.4; driver has been added to support NICs
      based on the 3Com 3XP Typhoon/Sidewinder (3CR990) chipset.</para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Network Protocols</title>

      <para>TCP now has RFC 1323 extensions enabled by default in
      &man.rc.conf.5;.</para>

      <para>RFC 1323 and RFC 1644 TCP extensions are now disabled for a
      connection in progress if no response has been received by the
      third SYN segment sent.  This behavior tries to work around
      (very old) terminal servers with buggy VJ header compression
      implementations.</para>

      <para>The <literal>TCP_RESTRICT_RST</literal> kernel option has
      been removed.  Similar functionality can be achieved with the
      <varname>net.inet.tcp.blackhole</varname> sysctl
      variable.</para>

      <para>The TCP implementation no longer requires the
      allocation of a TCP template structure for each connection; this
      should reduce the buffer usage on large systems handling many
      connections.</para>

      <para>A new sysctl <varname>net.inet.ip.check_interface</varname>,
      which is off by default, causes IP to verify that an incoming
      packet arrives on an interface that has an address matching the
      packet's destination address.</para>

      <para>A new <literal>options RANDOM_IP_ID</literal> kernel
      option causes the ID field of IP packets to be randomized.  This
      closes a minor information leak which allows a remote observer
      to determine the rate at which the machine is generating
      packets, since the default behavior is to increment a counter
      for each packet sent.</para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Disks and Storage</title>

      <para arch="i386">The &man.asr.4; driver now supports the Adaptec
      2000S and 2005S Zero-Channel RAID controllers.</para>

      <para arch="i386">The &man.aac.4; driver now supports the Adaptec
      SCSI RAID 5400S controller.</para>

      <para>The &man.ata.4; driver again has write-caching enabled by 
      default.</para>

      <para>The &man.wd.4; compatibility devices were removed from the
      &man.ata.4; driver.</para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Filesystems</title>

      <para arch="i386">smbfs (CIFS) support in kernel has been
      added.  The corresponding userland filesystem mount utility can be found 
      in the <port>net/smbfs</port> port in the &os; Ports 
      Collection.</para>

      <para>A simple hash-based lookup optimization for large directories
      called <literal>dirhash</literal> has been added.  Conditional on the
      <literal>UFS_DIRHASH</literal> kernel option, it improves the speed
      of operations on very large directories at the expense of some
      memory.</para>

    </sect3>

    <sect3>
      <title>Multimedia Support</title>

      <para arch="i386">A driver for the Advance Logic ALS4000 has
      been added.</para>

      <sect4 arch="i386">
        <title>isdn4bsd</title>

	<para><application>isdn4bsd</application> has been updated to
	version 1.0.1.  As a result of this update, users of the
	&man.i4bisppp.4; (kernel PPP over ISDN) driver
	<emphasis>must</emphasis> now use &man.ispppcontrol.8; instead
	of &man.spppcontrol.8; to configure and control these
	network interfaces.</para>

        PCI-TJ devices under <application>isdn4bsd</application> has
        been added.</para>

        <para>Experimental support for the Eicon.Diehl DIVA 2.0 and
        2.02 ISA PnP ISDN cards has been added to the &man.isic.4;
        <application>isdn4bsd</application> driver.</para> 

	<para>Active CAPI-based ISDN cards manufacured by AVM are now
	supported using the &man.i4bcapi.4; and the &man.iavc.4; driver. The
	supported cards are the AVM B1 PCI and AVM B1 ISA Basic Rate
	cards and the AVM T1 Primary Rate cards.</para>

	<para>A new <literal>maxconnecttime</literal> keyword is now
	accepted in &man.isdnd.rc.5; files to limit the time a
	connection may remain open.</para>

    <title>Security-Related Changes</title>

    <para>The security fix mentioned in security advisory
    FreeBSD-SA-01:39, which governs initial sequence number generation
    for TCP connections, has raised some possible compatibility
    issues.  To mitigate this effect, the fix can now be enabled or
    disabled using the
    <varname>net.inet.tcp.tcp_seq_genscheme</varname> sysctl
    variable.</para>

    <para>A vulnerability in the &man.fts.3; routines (used by
    applications for recursively traversing a filesystem) could
    allow a program to operate on files outside the intended directory
    hierarchy.  This bug has been fixed (see security advisory
    FreeBSD-SA-01:40).</para>

    <para>&man.portmap.8; is now turned off by default, although it
    will be started automatically on machines that enable NFS serving,
    NIS services, or &man.amd.8; through &man.rc.conf.5;.</para>

    <para>A flaw allowed some signal handlers to remain in effect in a
    child process after being exec-ed from its parent.  This allowed
    an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of a setuid
    binary.  This flaw has been corrected (see security advisory
    FreeBSD-SA-01:42).</para>

    <para>A remote buffer overflow in &man.tcpdump.1; has been fixed
    (see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:48).</para>

    <para>A remote buffer overflow in &man.telnetd.8; has been
    fixed (see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:49).</para>

    <para>The new <varname>net.inet.ip.maxfragpackets</varname> 
    and <varname>net.inet.ip6.maxfragpackets</varname> sysctl
    variables limit the amount of memory that can be consumed by IPv4
    and IPv6 packet fragments, which defends against some denial of service
    attacks (see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:52).</para>

    <para>The number of <quote>security profiles</quote> available in
    &man.sysinstall.8; for new installations has been reduced to two.</para>

    <para>All services in <filename>inetd.conf</filename> are now
    disabled by default for new installations.  &man.sysinstall.8;
    gives the option of enabling or disabling &man.inetd.8; on new
    installations, as well as editing
    <filename>inetd.conf</filename>.</para>

    <para>A flaw in the implementation of the &man.ipfw.8;
    <literal>me</literal> rules on point-to-point links has been
    corrected.  Formerly, <literal>me</literal> filter rules would
    match the remote IP address of a point-to-point interface in
    addition to the intended local IP address (see security advisory
    FreeBSD-SA-01:53).</para>

    <para>A vulnerability in &man.procfs.5;, which could allow a
    process to read sensitive information from another process's
    memory space, has been closed (see security advisory
    FreeBSD-SA-01:55).</para>

    <para>The <literal>PARANOID</literal> hostname checking in

    (see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:58).</para>

    <para>A race condition in &man.rmuser.8; that briefly exposed a
    world-readable <filename>/etc/master.passwd</filename> has been
    fixed (see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:59).</para>

  <sect2 id="userland">
    <title>Userland Changes</title>

    <para>&man.ip6fw.8; now has the ability to use a preprocessor and

    <para>&man.telnet.1; now supports a <option>-u</option> flag to
    allow connections to UNIX-domain (<literal>AF_UNIX</literal>)
    sockets.</para>

    <para>&man.newfs.8; now takes a <option>-U</option> option to

    <para>The &man.getprogname.3; and &man.setprogname.3; library
    functions have been added to manipulate the name of the current
    program.  They are used by error-reporting routines to produce
    consistent output.</para>

    <para>&man.xargs.1; now supports a <option>-J</option>
    <replaceable>replstr</replaceable> option that allows the user to
    tell &man.xargs.1; to insert the data read from standard input at
    a specific point in the command line arguments, rather than at the
    end.</para>

    <para>&man.ifconfig.8; now has support for setting parameters for
    IEEE 802.11 wireless network devices.  &man.wi.4; and
    &man.an.4; devices are supported.</para>

    <para>&man.ifconfig.8; no longer displays the list of supported
    media by default.  Instead it displays it when the

    <para>&man.lpd.8; now takes two new options:  <option>-c</option>
    will log all connection errors to &man.syslogd.8;, while
    <option>-W</option> will allow connections from non-reserved
    ports.</para>

    <para>&man.lpc.8; has been improved; <command>lpc clean</command>
    is now somewhat safer, and a new <command>lpc tclean</command>
    command has been added to check to see what files would be removed
    by <command>lpc clean</command>.</para>

    <para>&man.du.1; now takes a <option>-I</option> command-line flag
    to ignore/skip files and subdirectories matching a specified

    added.</para>

    <para>&man.mail.1; now takes a <option>-E</option> flag to avoid
    sending messages with empty bodies.</para>

    <para>&man.vidcontrol.1; now supports a <option>-C</option> option to
    clear the history buffer for a given tty, as well as a
    <option>-h</option> to set the size of the history buffer.</para>

    <para>&man.last.1; now implements a <option>-d</option> that provides a
    <quote>snapshot</quote> of who was logged in at a particular date and
    time.</para>

    <para><filename>libcrypt</filename> and
    <filename>libdescrypt</filename> have been unified to provide a
    configurable password authentication hash library.  Both the md5
    and des hash methods are provided unless the des hash is
    specifically compiled out.</para>

    <para>&man.install.1; has a number of new features, including the

    <option>-D</option> (debugging) flag has been withdrawn.
    &man.install.1; now issues a warning if <option>-d</option>
    (create directories) and <option>-C</option> (copy changed files
