  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current;.	It
    describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
    It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

<![ %release.type.current [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents the latest point along the &release.branch; development
    branch since &release.branch; was created.	Information regarding pre-built, binary
    &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

]]>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

  <para>The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents a point along the &release.branch; development
    branch between &release.prev; and the future &release.next;.
    Information regarding
    pre-built, binary &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <ulink url="&release.url;"></ulink>.</para>

<![ %release.type.release [

  <para>This distribution of &os; &release.current; is a
    &release.type; distribution.  It can be found at <ulink
    url="&release.url;"></ulink> or any of its mirrors.	 More
    information on obtaining this (or other) &release.type;
    distributions of &os; can be found in the <ulink

    &os;</quote> appendix</ulink> to the <ulink

  <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
    installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
    <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
    release cycle or after the release.	 Typically, it contains
    information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
    documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
    &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

    <title>What's New</title>

    <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
      features in &os; since &release.prev;.</para>

    <para>Typical release note items document recent security
      advisories issued after &release.prev;, new drivers or hardware
      support, new commands or options, major bug fixes, or
      contributed software upgrades.  They may also list changes to
      major ports/packages or release engineering practices.  Clearly
      the release notes cannot list every single change made to &os;
      between releases; this document focuses primarily on security
      advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
      improvements.</para>

      <para revision="232757">A bug which could cause a kernel thread
	to have a wrong CPU affinity configuration has been fixed.</para>

      <para revision="233584">A bug in VIMAGE &man.jail.8; which could
	make the network subsystem run on an wrong vnet context has been
	fixed.</para>

      <para revision="235121"><varname>debug.kdb.break_to_debugger</varname>
	and <varname>debug.kdb.alt_break_to_debugger</varname> have been
	added as &man.sysctl.8; variables and loader tunables.  These
	are disabled by default and <option>BREAK_TO_DEBUGGER</option>
	and <option>ALT_BREAK_TO_DEBUGGER</option> kernel options now
	set them enabled.  These changes allow
	<filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel to support break-to-debugger
	capability.</para>

      <para revision="236684">The &man.shm.map.9; and
	&man.shm.unmap.9; functions have been added to allow in-kernel
	code to map portions of shared memory objects created by
	&man.shm.open.2; into the kernel's address space.</para>

      <para revision="235502">A new &man.sysctl.8; variable
	<varname>kern.stop_scheduler_on_panic</varname> has been
	added.  When set to <literal>1</literal>, only one thread runs
	uninterruptedly after a system panic and the other CPUs are
	stopped.  The default value is <literal>0</literal>.</para>

      <para revision="233765,234094,236150">A bug that changes to a
	mapped file with the &man.mmap.2; system call were not flushed
	properly under certain circumstances has been fixed.  If a
	process has an NFS-backed file and adds changes to it,
	normally the changes are written into the backing store
	automatically.  However, the NFS client recognized the
	modified parts are written successfully even when the write
	operation was failed for some reason such as permission
	denied.</para>

	<title>Boot Loader Changes</title>

	<para revision="233377,234563" arch="amd64,i386,pc98">A bug in
	  &os; boot block has been fixed.  A pathname of the third
	  stage loader (or kernel) in the &man.boot.config.5;
	  configuration file could not be recognized.</para>

	<para revision="232963">A bug in &man.loader.8; which could

	<para revision="235998" arch="sparc64">&os; &man.loader.8; now
	  supports <command>heap</command> to show the heap
	  usage.</para>

	<para revision="234694">The <application>gptboot</application>
	  boot block now reads the backup GPT header from the last LBA
	  only when the primary GPT header and tables are invalid.
	  This mitigates interoperability issues with some
	  &man.geom.4; providers like <literal>MIRROR</literal> which
	  use the last LBA for the metadata.</para>

	<para revision="234680">A bug in the

	  prevent <option>-q</option> option from working has been
	  fixed.</para>

	<para revision="237765">The <filename>zfsboot</filename> boot
	  block and <filename>zfsloader</filename> support filesystems
	  within a ZFS storage pool.  In
	  <filename>zfsloader</filename>, the ZFS device name format
	  is now <filename>zfs:pool/fs</filename> and the fully
	  qualified file path format is
	  <filename>zfs:pool/fs:/path/to/file</filename>.  The
	  <filename>zfsboot</filename> boot block accepts the
	  kernel/loader name in the format
	  <filename>pool:fs:path/to/file</filename> or, as before,
	  <filename>pool:path/to/file</filename>.  In the latter case
	  a default filesystem is used (the pool root or a filesystem
	  with the bootfs property). The <filename>zfsboot</filename>
	  boot block passes the GUIDs of the selected storage pool and
	  dataset to <filename>zfsloader</filename> to be used as its
	  defaults.</para>

	  may list CPUs in different orders.  A new loader tunable
	  <varname>debug.acpi.cpu_unordered</varname> has been added
