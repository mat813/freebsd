  <sect1 id="intro">
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
      &release.current;.  It describes recently added, changed, or
      deleted features of &os;.  It also provides some notes on
      upgrading from previous versions of &os;.</para>

    <para>This distribution of &os; &release.current; is a
      &release.type; distribution.  It can be found at <ulink
      url="&release.url;"></ulink> or any of its mirrors.  More
      information on obtaining this (or other) &release.type;
      distributions of &os; can be found in the <ulink
      url="&url.books.handbook;/mirrors.html"><quote>Obtaining
      &os;</quote> appendix</ulink> to the <ulink
      url="&url.books.handbook;/">&os; Handbook</ulink>.</para>

    <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
      installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
      <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
      release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
      information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
      documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
      &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

  <sect1 id="new">
    <title>What's New</title>

    <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
      features in &os; since &release.prev;.</para>

    <para>Typical release note items document recent security
      advisories issued after &release.prev;, new drivers or hardware
      support, new commands or options, major bug fixes, or
      contributed software upgrades.  They may also list changes to
      major ports/packages or release engineering practices.  Clearly
      the release notes cannot list every single change made to &os;
      between releases; this document focuses primarily on security
      advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
      improvements.</para>

    <para>The latest, up-to-date version of the release notes are
      available online <ulink
	url="http://www.freebsd.org/releases/9.2R/relnotes-detailed.html">here</ulink>.</para>

      <title>Upgrading using &man.freebsd-update.8; or a source-based
	procedure</title>

      <para arch="amd64,i386">Beginning with &os; 6.2-RELEASE, binary
	upgrades between RELEASE versions (and snapshots of the
	various security branches) are supported using the
	&man.freebsd-update.8; utility.  The binary upgrade procedure
	will update unmodified userland utilities, as well as an
	unmodified <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel, distributed as
	a part of an official &os; release.  The
	&man.freebsd-update.8; utility requires that the host being
	upgraded have Internet connectivity.</para>

      <para>Source-based upgrades (those based on recompiling the &os;
	base system from source code) from previous versions are
	supported using to the instructions in
	<filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename>.</para>

      <para>For more specific information about upgrading
	instructions, see <ulink
	url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/9.2R/installation.html"></ulink>.</para>

      <important>
	<para>Upgrading &os; should, of course, only be attempted
	  after backing up <emphasis>all</emphasis> data and
	  configuration files.</para>

      <para>FreeBSD 9.0 and later have several incompatibilities in
	system configuration which you might want to know before
	upgrading your system.  <emphasis>Please read this section and
	the <ulink

	Section in 9.0-RELEASE Release Notes</ulink> carefully before
