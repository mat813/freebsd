    <para>The release notes for &os; &release.current; contain
      a summary of the changes made to the &os; base system on the
      &release.branch; development line.  This document lists
      applicable security advisories that were issued since the last
      release, as well as significant changes to the &os; kernel and
      userland.  Some brief remarks on upgrading are also
      presented.</para>

  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current;.  It describes recently added, changed, or
    deleted features of &os;.  It also provides some notes on
    upgrading from previous versions of &os;.</para>

  <para releasetype="current">The &release.type; distribution to which
    these release notes apply represents the latest point along the
    &release.branch; development branch since &release.branch; was
    created.  Information regarding pre-built, binary &release.type;
    distributions along this branch can be found at <uri
      xlink:href="&release.url;">&release.url;</uri>.</para>

  <para releasetype="snapshot">The &release.type; distribution to
    which these release notes apply represents a point along the
    &release.branch; development branch between &release.prev; and the
    future &release.next;.  Information regarding pre-built, binary
    &release.type; distributions along this branch can be found at
    <uri xlink:href="&release.url;">&release.url;</uri>.</para>

  <para releasetype="release">This distribution of &os;
    &release.current; is a &release.type; distribution.  It can be
    found at <uri xlink:href="&release.url;">&release.url;</uri> or
    any of its mirrors.  More information on obtaining this (or other)
    &release.type; distributions of &os; can be found in the <link

  <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before
    installing &os;.  The errata document is updated with
    <quote>late-breaking</quote> information discovered late in the
    release cycle or after the release.  Typically, it contains
    information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
    documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;
    &release.current; can be found on the &os; Web site.</para>

  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
    features in &os; since &release.prev;.</para>

  <para>Typical release note items document recent security advisories
    issued after &release.prev;, new drivers or hardware support, new
    commands or options, major bug fixes, or contributed software
    upgrades.  They may also list changes to major ports/packages or
    release engineering practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot
    list every single change made to &os; between releases; this
    document focuses primarily on security advisories, user-visible
    changes, and major architectural improvements.</para>

    <para revision="260338">The <literal>vfs.zfs.zio.use_uma</literal>
      &man.sysctl.8; has been re-enabled.  On multi-CPU machines with
      enough RAM, this can easily double &man.zfs.8; performance or
      reduce CPU usage in half.  It was originally disabled due to
      memory and <acronym>KVA</acronym> exhaustion problem reports,
      which should be resolved due to several change in the VM
      subsystem.</para>

    <para revision="260385" contrib="sponsor" sponsor="&ix;">The
      &man.geom.4; RAID driver has been
      updated to support unmapped I/O.</para>

    <para revision="260431">A new &man.sysctl.8;,
      <literal>kern.panic_reboot_wait_time</literal>, has been added,
      which allows controlling how long the system will wait after
      &man.panic.9; before rebooting.</para>

    <para revision="260857">The &man.virtio_blk.4; driver has been
      updated to support unmapped I/O.</para>

    <para revision="260858">The &man.virtio_scsi.4; driver has been
      updated to support unmapped I/O.</para>

    <para revision="262861">The &man.vt.4; driver has been merged
      from &os;-CURRENT.  To enable &man.vt.4;, enter

      during boot, or add <literal>kern.vty=vt</literal> to
      &man.loader.conf.5; and reboot the system.</para>

    <para revision="262967">Support for MegaRAID Fury cards has been
      added to the &man.mfi.4; driver.</para>

    <para revision="263024">The &man.aacraid.4; driver has been
      updated to version 3.2.5.</para>

    <para revision="265922" contrib="sponsor" sponsor="&lsi;">The
      &man.mrsas.4; driver has been added,
      providing support for LSI MegaRAID SAS controllers.  The
      &man.mfi.4; driver will attach to the controller, by default.
      To enable &man.mrsas.4; add
      <literal>hw.mfi.mrsas_enable=1</literal> to
      <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>, which turns off
      &man.mfi.4; device probing.</para>

    <note>
      <para>At this time, the &man.mfiutil.8; utility and
