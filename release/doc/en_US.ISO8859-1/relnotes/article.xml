  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current;.	It
    describes recently added, changed, or deleted features of &os;.
    It also provides some notes on upgrading
    from previous versions of &os;.</para>

  <para releasetype="current">The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes
    apply represents the latest point along the &release.branch; development
    branch since &release.branch; was created.	Information regarding pre-built, binary
    &release.type; distributions along this branch
    can be found at <uri xlink:href="&release.url;"></uri>.</para>

  <para releasetype="snapshot">The &release.type; distribution to which these release notes

  <para releasetype="release">This distribution of &os; &release.current; is a

  <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before

    <title>What's New</title>

    <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
      features in &os; since &release.prev;.</para>

    <para>Typical release note items document recent security
      advisories issued after &release.prev;, new drivers or hardware
      support, new commands or options, major bug fixes, or
      contributed software upgrades.  They may also list changes to
      major ports/packages or release engineering practices.  Clearly
      the release notes cannot list every single change made to &os;
      between releases; this document focuses primarily on security
      advisories, user-visible changes, and major architectural
      improvements.</para>

      <title>Kernel Changes</title>

      <para arch="ia64" revision="209326">The maximum number of pages
	used for DMA bounce buffer pool has been increased from 256 to
	1024.</para>

      <para arch="powerpc" revision="209765">The default value of
	<varname>kern.hz</varname> has been increased from 100 to
	1000.</para>

      <para arch="powerpc" revision="209767">The SMP kernel now works on
	MPC7400-based Apple desktop machines such as
	PowerMac3,3.</para>

      <para arch="powerpc" revision="211593">&os;/powerpc now supports
	DMA bounce buffer which is required on systems with larger RAM
	than 4GB.</para>

      <para arch="mips" revision="215938">&os;/mips support has been
	improved.  It now supports SMP on a SWARM with a dual-core
	Sibyte processor.</para>

      <para arch="mips">&os;/mips now supports Netlogic Microsystems'
	XLR and XLS multi-core processor families.</para>

      <para arch="sparc64" revision="215598">&os;/sparc64 now supports
	reservation-based physical memory allocation which provides
	better performance.</para>

      <para arch="amd64" revision="214620">&os;/amd64 now always sets
	the KVA space as equal to or larger than physical memory size.
	The default size was calculated based on one-third of the
	physical memory size by a code derived from one for i386.  It
	has been changed because constraints for memory space are not
	severe on amd64 and this change would help to prevent a
	<quote>kmem_map too small</quote> panic which often occurs
	when using ZFS.</para>

      <para arch="amd64,i386" revision="214621">CPU topology detection
	for Intel CPUs has been improved.</para>

      <para arch="amd64,i386" revision="215513">ACPI suspend/resume
	functionality support has been improved.</para>

      <para arch="amd64,i386" revision="215513">&os; kernel now
	supports <function>kern_fpu_enter()</function> and
	<function>kern_fpu_leave()</function> KPIs which allow the
	kernel subsystems to use XMM register files used in Intel SSE
	(Streaming SIMD Extensions).</para>

      <para arch="amd64,i386,ia64" revision="215006">The &man.acpi.4;
	driver now uses ACPI Reset Register capability by default only
	when a flag in the FADT which indicates it is available.  This
	behavior was controlled by a &man.sysctl.8; variable
	<varname>hw.acpi.handle_reboot</varname> and the default value
	was always set to <literal>0</literal>.</para>

      <para arch="amd64,i386,ia64" revision="215521">The &man.acpi.4;
	driver now supports new loader tunables

	details, see &man.acpi.4; manual page.</para>

      <para revision="209788">The &man.alq.9; support has been

	<function>alq_getn()</function> KPIs have been extended to
	support variable length messages, which is enabled at ALQ
	creation time depending on the arguments passed to
	<function>alq_open()</function>.  Also, the
	<literal>ALQ_NOACTIVATE</literal> and
	<literal>ALQ_ORDERED</literal> flags have been added to allow
	ALQ consumers to have more control over I/O scheduling and
	resource acquisition respectively.  These extensions are fully
	backward compatible.</para>

      <para revision="209783">The &man.alq.9; support is now provided
	as a kernel module <filename>alq.ko</filename>.</para>

      <para revision="209692">The &man.ddb.8; kernel debugger now
	supports an optional delay in <command>reset</command> and
	<command>reboot</command> commands.  This allows an
	administrator to break the system into debugger and trigger
	automatic textdump when an unattended panic occurs.</para>

      <para revision="212230">The &man.ddb.8; kernel debugger now
	supports a <command>show cdev</command> command.  This
	displays the list of all created cdev's, consisting of devfs
	node name and struct cdev address.</para>

      <para revision="214326">The &os; <filename>GENERIC</filename>
	kernel is now compiled with <option>KDB</option> and
	<option>KDB_TRACE</option> options.  From 8.2-RELEASE the
	kernel supports displaying a stack trace on panic by using
	&man.stack.9; facility with no debugger backend like
	&man.ddb.8;.  Note that this does not change the default
	behaviors of the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel on
	panic.</para>

      <para revision="213554,213556,213560">The following
	&man.sysctl.8; variables are also now loader tunables:

	<varname>debug.kdb.stop_cpus</varname>,
	<varname>debug.trace_on_panic</varname>, and
	<varname>kern.sync_on_panic</varname>.  Also, new

	for the current kmem map size and
	<varname>vm.kmem_map_free</varname> for largest contiguous
	free range in kmem map, <varname>vfs.ncsizefactor</varname>
	for size factor for namecache, and
	<varname>vfs.ncnegfactor</varname> for ratio of negative
	namecache entries have been added.</para>

      <para revision="212427">The &os; &man.memguard.9; framework has
	been improved to make it able to detect use-after-free of
	allocated memories over a longer time.  For more details, see
	&man.memguard.9; manual page.</para>

      <para revision="214756"><literal>PT_LWPINFO</literal> request to
	obtain information about the kernel thread that caused the
	traced process to stop in the &man.ptrace.2; process tracing
	and debugging facility has been improved.  It now reports
	system call entry and leave events, as well as availability of
	<varname>siginfo_t</varname> accompanying the reported
	signal.</para>

      <para revision="214254">The &os; &man.crypto.4; framework

	defined in IEEE Std. 1619-2007.</para>

      <para arch="amd64" revision="215788">Xen HVM support in
