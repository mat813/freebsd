    <para>For instructions on installing FreeBSD, please see Chapter 2
      of The FreeBSD Handbook.  It provides a complete installation
      walk-through for users new to FreeBSD, and can be found online

      <title>Upgrading from Source</title>

      <para>The procedure for doing a source code based update is
	described in
	<ulink url="&url.books.handbook;/synching.html"></ulink> and
	<ulink url="&url.books.handbook;//makeworld.html"></ulink>.</para>

      <para>The branch tag to use for updating the source is
	<literal>RELENG_8_4</literal> for CVS.  For SVN use

      <title>Upgrading Using <quote>&os; Update</quote></title>

      <para>The &man.freebsd-update.8; utility supports binary
	upgrades of &arch.i386; and &arch.amd64; systems running
	earlier FreeBSD releases. Systems running
	<literal>7.[01234]-RELEASE</literal>,
	<literal>8.[0123]-RELEASE</literal>,
	<literal>8.4-BETA1</literal>, or
	<literal>8.4-RC[12]</literal> can upgrade as follows:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; freebsd-update upgrade -r 8.4-RELEASE</screen>

      <para>During this process, FreeBSD Update may ask the user to
	help by merging some configuration files or by confirming that
	the automatically performed merging was done correctly.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; freebsd-update install</screen>

      <para>The system must be rebooted with the newly installed
	kernel before continuing.</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; shutdown -r now</screen>

      <para>After rebooting, &man.freebsd-update.8; needs to be run
	again to install the new userland components:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; freebsd-update install</screen>

      <para>At this point, users of systems being upgraded from
	FreeBSD 7.4-RELEASE or earlier will be prompted by
	freebsd-update to rebuild all third-party applications (e.g.,
	ports installed from the ports tree) due to updates in system
	libraries.</para>

      <para>After updating installed third-party applications (and
	again, only if &man.freebsd-update.8; printed a message
	indicating that this was necessary), run
	&man.freebsd-update.8; again so that it can delete the old (no
	longer used) system libraries:</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; freebsd-update install</screen>

      <para>Finally, reboot into &release.current;</para>

      <screen>&prompt.root; shutdown -r now</screen>
