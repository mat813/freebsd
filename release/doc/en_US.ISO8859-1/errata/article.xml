	This information includes security advisories, as well as news
	relating to the software or documentation that could affect its
	operation or usability.  An up-to-date version of this document
	should always be consulted before installing this version of
	&os;.</para>

    <para>This errata document contains <quote>late-breaking news</quote>
      about &os; &release.prev;
      Before installing this version, it is important to consult this
      document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
      that may already have been found and fixed.</para>

    <para>Any version of this errata document actually distributed
      with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be
      out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on
      the Internet and should be consulted as the <quote>current
      errata</quote> for this release.  These other copies of the
      errata are located at
      <link xlink:href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/" />,
      plus any sites
      which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also
      contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of

      <listitem>
	<para>&os;/&arch.i386; &release.prev; running as a guest
	  operating system on <application>VirtualBox</application>
	  can have a problem with disk I/O access.  It depends on some
	  specific hardware configuration and does not depend on a
	  specific version of <application>VirtualBox</application> or
	  host operating system.</para>

	<para>It causes various errors and makes &os; quite unstable.
	  Although the cause is still unclear, disabling unmapped I/O
	  works as a workaround.  To disable it, choose <literal>Escape to
	    loader prompt</literal> in the boot menu and enter the following
	  lines from &man.loader.8; prompt, after
	  an <literal>OK</literal>:</para>

	<screen>set vfs.unmapped_buf_allowed=0
boot</screen>

	<para>Note that the following line has to be added to
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> after a boot.
          It disables unmapped I/O at every boot:</para>

	<programlisting>vfs.unmapped_buf_allowed=0</programlisting>

      <listitem>
	<para>A bug in <application>Heimdal</application> (an
	  implementation of <application>Kerberos</application>
	  authentication in &os; base system) has been fixed.  It
	  could cause an interoperability issue between
	  <application>Heimdal</application> and the other
	  implementations including <application>MIT
	  Kerberos</application>.  However, due to this fix,
	  <application>Heimdal</application> and some applications
	  which depend on it in the previous &os; releases do not work
	  with one in &release.prev; in certain cases.  Errata Notice
	  for the supported releases to fix it will be
	  released.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>A bug in &man.killall.1; has been discovered.  It
	  makes <userinput>killall -INT</userinput> to deliver
	  <literal>SIGTERM</literal> rather than the desired
	  <literal>SIGINT</literal>, and may cause blocking
	  behavior for scripts that uses it, as <literal>-I</literal>
	  means <quote>interactive</quote>.  A workaround of this
	  would be to use <literal>-SIGINT</literal> instead.
	  This bug has been fixed on &os;-CURRENT and will be fixed
	  in &os;-STABLE.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>In some NFSv4 environments, &man.bxe.4; with
	  <literal>tso</literal> enabled may experience issues with
	  packet corruption, resulting in poor performance.  In some
	  cases, turning off <literal>tso</literal> will resolve the
	  issue.  See &man.ifconfig.8; for more information about the
	  <literal>-tso</literal> flag.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Due to a minor incompatibility with &man.pkg.7; version
	  <literal>1.2.x</literal>, &man.bsdconfig.8; will duplicate
	  the list of available packages for installation.  This is
	  due to the <literal>PACKAGESITE</literal> environment
	  variable being set for backwards compatibility with older
	  versions of &man.pkg.7;.  This affects generation of the
	  generation of the available package list only, and does not
	  affect the behavior when processing packages for
	  installation.</para>
