	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

    <para>[20130613] The &man.vtnet.4; network interface driver
      displays the following message upon configuration when using
      <application>QEMU</application> 1.4.1 and later:</para>

    <screen>vtnet0: error setting host MAC filter table</screen>

    <para>This message is harmless when the interface has only one MAC
      address.  The patch for this issue is filed to a PR <link
      xlink:href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=178955">kern/178955</link>.</para>

    <para>[20130609] There is incompatibility in &man.jail.8;
      configuration because the &man.jail.8; utility and
      <filename>rc.d/jail</filename> script has been changed.  More
      specifically, the following &man.sysctl.8; variables cannot be
      used to set the default parameters for jails:</para>

    <programlisting>security.jail.mount_zfs_allowed
security.jail.mount_procfs_allowed
security.jail.mount_nullfs_allowed
security.jail.mount_devfs_allowed
security.jail.mount_allowed
security.jail.chflags_allowed
security.jail.allow_raw_sockets
security.jail.sysvipc_allowed
security.jail.socket_unixiproute_only
security.jail.set_hostname_allowed</programlisting>

    <para>These could be set by manually using &man.sysctl.8; utility,
      the &man.sysctl.conf.5; file, or for some of them the following
      variables in &man.rc.conf.5;:</para>

    <programlisting>jail_set_hostname_allow="yes"
jail_socket_unixiproute_only="yes"
jail_sysvipc_allow="yes"</programlisting>

    <para>These parameters must now be specified in
      <varname>jail_parameters</varname> (or
      <varname>jail_<replaceable>jailname</replaceable>_parameters</varname>
      for per-jail configuration) in &man.rc.conf.5;.  For
      example:</para>

    <programlisting>jail_parameters="allow.sysvipc allow.raw_sockets"</programlisting>

    <para>The valid keywords are the following.  For more detail, see
      &man.jail.8; manual page.</para>

    <programlisting>allow.set_hostname
allow.sysvipc
allow.raw_sockets
allow.chflags
allow.mount
allow.mount.devfs

allow.mount.zfs

    <para>[20130608] &os; &release; no longer supports &os; CVS
      repository.  Some documents mistakenly refer to
      <literal>RELENG_8_4_0_RELEASE</literal> as CVS tag for the release and
      <literal>RELENG_8_4</literal> as CVS branch tag for the
      &release; security branch.  However, &os; Project no longer
      supports &os; CVS repository and &release; has been released by
      using &os; subversion repository instead.
      <literal>RELENG_8_4</literal> corresponds to
      <literal>svn://svn.FreeBSD.org/base/releng/8.4</literal>, and
      <literal>RELENG_8_4_0_RELEASE</literal> corresponds to
      <literal>svn://svn.FreeBSD.org/base/release/8.4.0</literal>.
      Please note that &os; source tree for &release; and its security
      branch cannot be updated by using official CVSup servers.</para>

    <para>[20130607] (removed about a &man.bge.4; network interface
	driver issue because it was incorrect)</para>

    <para>[20130606] The &man.fxp.4; network interface driver may not
      work well with the &man.dhclient.8; utility.  More specifically,
      if the <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> has the following
      line:</para>

    <programlisting>ifconfig_fxp0="DHCP"</programlisting>

    <para>to activate a DHCP client to configure the network
      interface, the following notification messages are displayed and
      the &man.dhclient.8; utility keeps trying to initialize the
      network interface forever.</para>

    <screen>kernel: fxp0: link state changed to UP
kernel: fxp0: link state changed to DOWN</screen>

    <para>A patch to fix this issue will be released as an Errata
      Notice.</para>

    <para>[20130606] As described in &os; &release; Release Notes,
      &os; ZFS subsystem has been updated to support feature flags for
      ZFS pools.  However, the default version number of a newly
      created ZFS pool is still <literal>28</literal>.</para>

    <para>This is because &os; 9.0 and 9.1 do not support the feature
      flags.  This means ZFS pools with feature flag support cannot be
      used on &os; 9.0 and 9.1.  An 8.X system with v28 ZFS pools can
      be upgraded to 9.X with no problem.  Note that &man.zfs.8;
      <command>send</command> and <command>receive</command> commands
      do not work between pools with different versions.  Once a ZFS
      pool is upgraded from v28, there is no way to upgrade the system
      to &os; 9.0 and 9.1.  &os; 9.2 and later will support ZFS pools
      with feature flags.</para>

    <para>To create a ZFS pool with feature flag support, use the
      &man.zpool.8; <command>create</command> command and then the
      &man.zpool.8; <command>upgrade</command> command.</para>
