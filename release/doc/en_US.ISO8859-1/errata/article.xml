    <abstract>
      <para>This document lists errata items for &os; &release;,
	containing significant information discovered after the
	release or too late in the release cycle to be otherwise
	included in the release documentation.  This information
	includes security advisories, as well as news relating to the
	software or documentation that could affect its operation or
	usability.  An up-to-date version of this document should
	always be consulted before installing this version of
	&os;.</para>

      <para>This errata document for &os; &release; will be maintained
	until the release of &os; &release.next;.</para>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This errata document contains <quote>late-breaking
	news</quote> about &os; &release;.  Before installing this
      version, it is important to consult this document to learn about
      any post-release discoveries or problems that may already have
      been found and fixed.</para>

    <para>Any version of this errata document actually distributed
      with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be
      out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on
      the Internet and should be consulted as the <quote>current
	errata</quote> for this release.  These other copies of the
      errata are located at <link
	xlink:href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/" />, plus any
      sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also
      contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of
      the snapshot).</para>

    <para>For a list of all &os; CERT security advisories, see <link

	<para>&os;/&arch.i386; installed on ZFS may crash during boot
	  when the ZFS pool mount is attempted while booting an
	  unmodified <literal>GENERIC</literal> kernel.</para>

	<para>A system tunable has been added as of revision
	  <literal>r286584</literal> to make the
	  <literal>kern.kstack_pages</literal> tunable configurable
	  without recompiling the kernel.</para>

	<para>To mitigate system crashes with such configurations,
	  choose <literal>Escape to loader prompt</literal> in the
	  boot menu and enter the following lines from &man.loader.8;
	  prompt, after an <literal>OK</literal>:</para>

	<screen>set kern.kstack_pages=4
boot</screen>

	<para>Add this line to
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> for the change to
	  persist across reboots:</para>

	<para>[2017-07-25] &os;/&arch.arm64; currently lacks
	  <acronym>EFI</acronym> real-time clock
	  (<acronym>RTC</acronym>) support, which may cause the system
	  to boot with the wrong time set.</para>

	<para>As a workaround, either enable &man.ntpdate.8; or
	  include <literal>ntpd_sync_on_start="YES"</literal> in

	<para>[2017-07-25] A late issue was discovered with
	  &os;/&arch.arm64; and &quot;root on
	  <acronym>ZFS</acronym>&quot; installations where the root
	  <acronym>ZFS</acronym> pool would fail to be located.</para>

	<para>There currently is no workaround.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>[2017-11-06] An issue with &os; virtual machines with
	  <application>vagrant</application> was discovered that
	  affects the <application>VirtualBox</application> where the
	  virtual machine will not start on the initial boot invoked
	  with <literal>vagrant up</literal>.</para>

	<para>The issue is due to the virtual machine
	  <acronym>MAC</acronym> being unset, as &os; does not provide
	  a default <filename>Vagrantfile</filename>.</para>

	<para>It has been observed, however, that a subsequent
	  invocation of <literal>vagrant up</literal> will allow the
	  virtual machine to successfully boot, allowing access via
	  <literal>vagrant ssh</literal>.</para>

      <listitem>
	<para>[2018-06-21] An issue had been discovered late in the
	  release cycle where removing <acronym>ZFS</acronym> vdevs
	  from a pool under certain conditions would cause a system
	  crash when &man.zfsd.8; is enabled in
	  &man.rc.conf.5;.</para>

	<para>At present, it is believed to be limited to removal of
	  a <literal>mirror</literal> vdev from a pool consisting of
	  multiple <literal>mirror</literal> vdevs.</para>
