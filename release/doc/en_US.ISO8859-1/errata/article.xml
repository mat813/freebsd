	includes security advisories, as well as news relating to the

	usability.  An up-to-date version of this document should

      been found and fixed.</para>

    <para>Any version of this errata document actually distributed
      with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be

	<para>An issue was discovered with Amazon&reg; EC2&trade;
	  images which would cause the virtual machine to hang during
	  boot when upgrading from previous FreeBSD versions.  New
	  EC2&trade; installations are not affected, but existing
	  installations running earlier releases are advised to wait
	  until the issue is resolved in an Errata Notice before
	  upgrading.  An Errata Notice to address this is planned
	  following the release.</para>

	  without recompiling the kernel.</para>

	<para>To mitigate system crashes with such configurations,
	  chose <literal>Escape to loader prompt</literal> in the boot
	  menu and enter the following lines from &man.loader.8;
	  prompt, after an <literal>OK</literal>:</para>

	<para revision="293860">[2016-10-20] Several recent Dell
	  systems fail to find a bootable disk when the system boots
	  in Legacy/BIOS/CSM mode, the boot disk is partitioned with
	  <acronym>GPT</acronym>, and the Active flag in the
	  Protective <acronym>MBR</acronym> is not set.  To work
	  around this issue, either configure the system to boot in
	  <acronym>UEFI</acronym> mode, or choose the &quot;GPT
	  + Active&quot; scheme.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>[2016-10-21] Support for <literal>sha512</literal> and
	  <literal>skein</literal> checksumming has been added to the
	  <acronym>ZFS</acronym> filesystem.  This was not mentioned
	  in the release notes.</para>

	<para>Systems being upgraded from earlier &os; releases with
	  <acronym>ZFS</acronym> will see a message in <literal>zpool
	    status</literal> output noting the pool is not at the
	  latest version, and some features may not be enabled.
	  Additional instructions on how to update
	  <acronym>ZFS</acronym> pools to the latest version and
	  update the boot blocks for all boot drives in the pool will
	  also be provided in the output.</para>

	<para>This information is also documented in
	  <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename>, which is included if
	  the <literal>src</literal> component is selected during
	  installation.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>[2016-10-21] The size of the <acronym>GPT</acronym>
	  enabled <acronym>ZFS</acronym> boot blocks
	  (<filename>/boot/gptzfsboot</filename>) has increased past
	  64K.  Systems upgraded from older releases may experience
	  a problem where the size of the existing
	  &quot;freebsd-boot&quot; partition is too small to hold the
	  new <filename>gptzfsboot</filename>.</para>

	<para>Systems where the boot partition is immediately followed
	  by the swap partition, such as those installed via
	  &man.bsdinstall.8;, can resize the swap partition slightly
	  using the &man.gpart.8; <literal>resize</literal> command,
	  so space can be reclaimed to increase the size of the
	  freebsd-boot partition.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>[2016-10-21] Due to a bug in earlier versions of
	  &man.clang.1; that is difficult to work around in the
	  upgrade process, to upgrade the system from sources via
	  buildworld to -CURRENT or &release;, it is necessary to
	  upgrade machines running 9.x to at least revision r286035,
	  or machines running 10.x to revision r286033.  Source-based
	  upgrades from 10.3-RELEASE are not affected.  This differs
	  from the historical situation where one could generally
	  upgrade from anywhere on earlier stable branches, so caution
	  should be exercised.</para>
