      <para>This document lists errata items for &os; &release;,
	containing significant information discovered after the release
	or too late in the release cycle to be otherwise included in the
	release documentation.
	This information includes security advisories, as well as news
	relating to the software or documentation that could affect its
	operation or usability.  An up-to-date version of this document
	should always be consulted before installing this version of
	&os;.</para>

      <para>This errata document for &os; &release;
	will be maintained until the release of &os; &release.next;.</para>

    <para>This errata document contains <quote>late-breaking news</quote>
      about &os; &release;
      Before installing this version, it is important to consult this
      document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
      that may already have been found and fixed.</para>

    <para>Any version of this errata document actually distributed
      with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be
      out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on
      the Internet and should be consulted as the <quote>current
      errata</quote> for this release.  These other copies of the
      errata are located at
      <link xlink:href="https://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/" />,
      plus any sites
      which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also
      contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of
      the snapshot).</para>

	<para>An issue was discovered with Amazon&reg; EC2&trade;
	  images which would cause the virtual machine to hang during
	  boot when upgrading from previous FreeBSD versions. New
	  EC2&trade; installations are not affected, but exisiting
	  installations running earlier releases are advised to wait
	  until the issue is resolved in an Errata Notice before
	  upgrading.  An Errata Notice to address this is planned
	  following the release.</para>

	<para>&os;/&arch.i386; installed on ZFS may crash during boot
	  when the ZFS pool mount is attempted while booting an
	  unmodified <literal>GENERIC</literal> kernel.</para>

	<para>A system tunable has been added as of revision
	  <literal>r286584</literal> to make the
	  <literal>kern.kstack_pages</literal> tunable configurable
	  without recompiling the kernel.</para>

	<para>To mitigate system crashes with such configurations,
	  chose <literal>Escape to loader prompt</literal> in the boot
	  menu and enter the following lines from &man.loader.8;
	  prompt, after an <literal>OK</literal>:</para>

	<screen>set kern.kstack_pages=4

	<para>Add this line to

	  handler on amd64 systems which have <acronym>PCID</acronym>
	  features but do not implement the <acronym>INVPCID</acronym>

	  boot:</para>

boot</screen>

	<para>Add this line to
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> for the change to
	  persist across reboots:</para>

	<para>To check if the system is affected, check
	  &man.dmesg.8; for <acronym>PCID</acronym> listed in the
	  &quot;Features2&quot;, and absence of
	  <acronym>INVPCID</acronym> in the &quot;Structured Extended
	  Features&quot;.  If the <acronym>PCID</acronym> feature is
