	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

    <para>This errata document contains <quote>late-breaking news</quote>

      Before installing this version, it is important to consult this
      document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
      that may already have been found and fixed.</para>

    <para>Any version of this errata document actually distributed
      with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be
      out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on
      the Internet and should be consulted as the <quote>current
      errata</quote> for this release.  These other copies of the
      errata are located at <ulink
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/"></ulink>, plus any sites
      which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also
      contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of
      the snapshot).</para>

    <para>For a list of all &os; CERT security advisories, see <ulink

    <title>Security Advisories</title>

    <para>No active security advisories.</para>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

    <para>Buffer overflows in kadmind(8) and k5admin could potentially
      cause the administrative server to execute arbitrary code.
      Bugfix and workaround information can be found in security
      advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-02:40.kadmind.asc">FreeBSD-SA-02:40</ulink>.</para>

    <para>Errors in &man.smrsh.8;, which could allow users to
      circumvent restrictions on what programs can be executed, were
      fixed in &os; &release.prev;.  Because the applicable security
      advisory (<ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-02:41.smrsh.asc">FreeBSD-SA-02:41</ulink>)
      was not issued after the release, this fact was not included in
      the release notes.</para>

    <para>Buffer overflows in the DNS &man.resolver.3;, which could
      cause some applications to fail, have been corrected.  This
      change was not mentioned in the release notes, as the applicable
      security advisory (<ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-02:42.resolv.asc">FreeBSD-SA-02:42</ulink>)
      was not issued until after the release.</para>

    <para>Several vulnerabilities exist in the version of
      <application>BIND</application> included with &os;
      &release.prev;.  More information, including bugfixes and
      workaround suggestions, can be found in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-02:43.bind.asc">FreeBSD-SA-02:43</ulink>.</para>

    <title>Late-Breaking News</title>

<![ %release.type.release [
    <para>No news.</para>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [
    <para>Due to licensing issues uncovered late in &os;
      &release.prev;'s release cycle, the &man.matcd.4; driver was
      removed.</para>

    <para>The <filename>srelease</filename> distribution contains
      object files for &man.sysinstall.8; in the
      <filename>release/sysinstall</filename> directory.  These files
      were generated during the release building process but, for some
      reason, were not removed from the distribution files.  They are
      harmless.</para>

    <para>The <filename role="package">databases/rdfdb</filename> and
      <filename role="package">mail/ssmtp</filename> packages
      included in the &release.prev; package set cannot be
      installed correctly.  A workaround is to build and install these
      programs using the Ports Collection.</para>

    <para>The <filename role="package">net/gnomeicu</filename> package
      included in the &release.prev; package set may not run
      correctly, due to a missing dependency on the <filename
      role="package">net/gnet</filename> package.  To work around this
      problem, install <filename role="package">net/gnet</filename> either
      from a package or the Ports Collection, preferably before
      installing <filename role="package">net/gnomeicu</filename>.</para>

    <para>The release notes for &os; &release.prev; incorrectly stated
      that the <option>-J</option> option to &man.xargs.1; is
      deprecated.  In fact, there are no plans to remove this
      option.</para>

    <para>&man.ftpd.8; has a bug in its virtual hosting function
      triggered if <filename>/etc/ftphosts</filename> defines a
      virtual host whose IP address can resolve back to a hostname.
      In that case the daemon will be exiting on <literal>SIGSEGV</literal>
      (signal 11) if started from &man.inetd.8;, or may malfunction
      unpredictably if running stand-alone.  This bug has been fixed
      in &os; &release.current;.</para>
