	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

    <para>[20080229] &man.tcpdump.1; does not correctly print the
      TX/RX rates for 802.11 frames.  This issue has been fixed on the
      HEAD and RELENG_7 branches.</para>

    <para>[20080229] A bug in Linux emulation may cause segmentation
      faults for some Linux programs using &man.mmap.2;.  This issue
      has been fixed on the HEAD and RELENG_7 branches.</para>

    <para>[20080229] Instances of packet corruption and instability
      have been observed with the &man.re.4; network driver.  Some
      users have reported that using a newer version of this driver
      (on HEAD) has solved their problems, or at least mitigated
      them.</para>

    <para>[20080229, updated 20080817] A change in the way that &os; sends TCP options
      has been reported to cause connectivity issues.
      This problem has been corrected on
      HEAD and the RELENG_7 and RELENG_7_0 branches..  Further
      details are contained in errta notice
      <ulink url="http://security.FreeBSD.org/advisories/FreeBSD-EN-08:02.tcp.asc">FreeBSD-EN-08:02.tcp</ulink>.</para>

    <para>[20080307] The &os; implementation of SCTP currently depends
      on having <literal>INET6</literal> support compiled into the
      kernel.  This requirement is planned to be removed in future
      releases.</para>

    <para>[20080307] Source upgrades from &os;
      6.<replaceable>X</replaceable> to &os; &release.bugfix; will
      generate warnings from &man.kldxref.8; during
      the <literal>installkernel</literal> step.  These warnings are
      harmless and can be ignored.</para>

    <para>[20080307] The &man.crypto.4; driver, which is required for
      IPsec functionality, has severe problems on &os;/&arch.powerpc;
      (a kernel with <literal>device crypto</literal> included in its
      configuration will be non-functional).</para>

    <para>[20080229] The &os; &release.bugfix; release documentation
      (release notes, hardware notes, and so forth) all contained a

      the <literal>freebsd-current</literal> mailing list.  This note
      should not have appeared.</para>

    <para>[20080229] The release notes gave an incorrect version
      number for KDE.  The correct version number is 3.5.8.</para>
