<!--
	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

      Before installing this version, it is important to consult this
      document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
      that may already have been found and fixed.</para>

    <para>Any version of this errata document actually distributed
      with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be
      out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on
      the Internet and should be consulted as the <quote>current
      errata</quote> for this release.  These other copies of the
      errata are located at <ulink

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also

    <para>[20080229] &man.tcpdump.1; does not correctly print the
      TX/RX rates for 802.11 frames.  This issue has been fixed on the
      HEAD and RELENG_7 branches.</para>

    <para>[20080229] A bug in Linux emulation may cause segmentation
      faults for some Linux programs using &man.mmap.2;.  This issue
      has been fixed on the HEAD and RELENG_7 branches.</para>

    <para>[20080229] Instances of packet corruption and instability
      have been observed with the &man.re.4; network driver.  Some
      users have reported that using a newer version of this driver
      (on HEAD) has solved their problems, or at least mitigated
      them.</para>

    <para>[20080229] A change in the way that &os; sends TCP options
      has been reported to cause odd interactions with some cable
      modem routers.  While this issue is still under investigation,
      a change has been committed to HEAD that returns the option
      processing to that of &os; 6 has shown some promising
      results.</para>
