	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

    <para>This document lists errata items for &os; 
    &release.prev;, containing significant information
    discovered after the release.  This information includes 
    security advisories, as well as
    news relating to the software or documentation
    that could affect its operation or usability.  An up-to-date
    version of this document should always be consulted before
    installing this version of &os;.</para>

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This errata document contains <quote>late-breaking news</quote>
    about &os; &release.prev;.  Before installing this version,
    it is important to consult this document to learn about
    any post-release discoveries or 
    problems that may already have been found and
    fixed.</para>

    <para>Any
    version of this
    errata document actually distributed with the
    release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of
    date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and
    should be consulted as the <quote>current errata</quote> for this
    release.  These other copies of the errata are located at <ulink
    url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/"></ulink>,
    plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this
    location.</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also
    contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of the
    snapshot).</para>

    <para>Any changes to this file will also be emailed to the
    &a.stable;.</para>

    <para>For a list of all &os; CERT security advisories, see <ulink

    <title>Security Advisories</title>

    <para>The vulnerability documented in security advisory
    FreeBSD-SA-01:39 was fixed in &os; &release.prev;.  The release
    notes mentioned the fix, but made no mention of the security
    advisory.</para>

    <para>A vulnerability in the &man.fts.3; routines (used by
    applications for recursively traversing a filesystem) could allow
    a program to operate on files outside the intended directory
    hierarchy.  This bug, as well as a fix, is described in security
    advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:40.</para>

    <para>A flaw allowed some signal handlers to remain in effect in a
    child process after being exec-ed from its parent.  This allowed
    an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of a setuid
    binary.  More details, as well as a fix, are described in security
    advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:42.</para>

    <para>A remote buffer overflow in &man.tcpdump.1; could be
    triggered by sending certain packets at a target machine.  More
    details, as well as a fix, can be found in security advisory
    FreeBSD-SA-01:48.</para>

    <para>A remote buffer overflow in &man.telnetd.8; could result in
    arbitrary code running on a target machine.  More details, as well
    as a fix, can be found in security advisory
    FreeBSD-SA-01:49.</para>

    <para>A vulnerability whereby a remote attacker could exhaust a
    target's pool of network buffers has been closed.  More details,
    as well as a fix, can be found in security advisory
    FreeBSD-SA-01:52.</para>

    <para>A flaw in the implementation of the &man.ipfw.8;
    <literal>me</literal> rules on point-to-point links has been
    corrected.  Formerly, <literal>me</literal> filter rules would
    match the remote IP address of a point-to-point interface in
    addition to the intended local IP address.  More details, as well
    as a fix, can be found in security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:53.</para>

    <para>A vulnerability in &man.procfs.5;, which could allow a
    process to read sensitive information from another process's
    memory space, has been closed.  For more details, as well as
    information on patches, see security advisory FreeBSD-SA-01:54.</para>

    <title>System Update Information</title>

    <para>The release note entry for the ESS Maestro-3/Allegro sound
    driver gave an incorrect command for loading the driver via
    <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>.  The correct command is:</para>

    <programlisting>snd_maestro3_load="YES"</programlisting>

    <para>&man.ssh.1; is no longer SUID <username>root</username>.
    The primary manifestation of this change is that
    <filename>.shosts</filename> authentication may not work
    <quote>out of the box</quote>.  Both temporary and permanent fixes
    are described in <ulink
    url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/doc/en_US.ISO_8859-1/books/faq/admin.html#SSH-SHOSTS">an item in the FAQ</ulink>.</para>
