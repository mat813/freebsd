<!-- 
	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

    <para>This errata document contains <quote>late-breaking news</quote>

      Before installing this version, it is important to consult this
      document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
      that may already have been found and fixed.</para>

    <para>Any version of this errata document actually distributed
      with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be
      out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on
      the Internet and should be consulted as the <quote>current
      errata</quote> for this release.  These other copies of the
      errata are located at <ulink
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/"></ulink>, plus any sites
      which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also
      contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of
      the snapshot).</para>

    <para>For a list of all &os; CERT security advisories, see <ulink
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/security/"></ulink> or <ulink

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

    <para>Certain <application>OpenSSH</application>
    clients, when attempting to connect to a &os; &release.prev;
    server, will unexpectedly present an
    <application>S/Key</application> prompt, even if &man.sshd.8; on
    the server has not been configured for
    <application>S/Key</application> authentication.  As a workaround,
    uncomment the
    <literal>ChallengeResponseAuthentication no</literal> line in
    <filename>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</filename> (on the server
    host).  This behavior has been observed with
    <application>OpenSSH</application> 3.0.1 and 3.0.2 clients.</para>

    <para>The release notes mentioned the new sbni device driver, but
    gave an incorrect reference to the program in the &os; Ports
    Collection used to configure the driver.  The correct filename for
    the port is <port>sysutils/sbniconfig</port>.</para>
