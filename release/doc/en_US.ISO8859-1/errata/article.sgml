	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

    <para>This document lists errata items for &os; &release.bugfix;,
      containing significant information discovered after the release
      or too late in the release cycle to be otherwise included in the
      release documentation.
      This information includes security advisories, as well as news
      relating to the software or documentation that could affect its
      operation or usability.  An up-to-date version of this document
      should always be consulted before installing this version of

    <para>This errata document contains <quote>late-breaking news</quote>
      about &os; &release.bugfix;.
      Before installing this version, it is important to consult this
      document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
      that may already have been found and fixed.</para>

    <para>Any version of this errata document actually distributed
      with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be
      out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on
      the Internet and should be consulted as the <quote>current
      errata</quote> for this release.  These other copies of the
      errata are located at <ulink
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/"></ulink>, plus any sites
      which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also
      contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of
      the snapshot).</para>

    <para>(6 May 2005) An error in the default permissions on the
      <filename class="devicefile">/dev/iir</filename> device node,
      which allowed unprivileged local users to send commands to the
      hardware supported by the &man.iir.4; driver.  Although the
      error was fixed prior to &release.prev;, it was applied too late
      in the release cycle to be mentioned in the release notes.  For
      more information, see security advisory
      <ulink url="ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-05:06.iir.asc">FreeBSD-SA-05:06.iir</ulink>.

    <para>(6 May 2005) A bug in the validation of &man.i386.get.ldt.2;
      system call input arguments, which may allow kernel memory may
      be disclosed to the user process, has been fixed.  This bug was
      fixed prior to &release.prev;, although not in time to be
      mentioned in the release notes.  For more information, see
      security advisory

    <para>(6 May 2005) Several information disclosure vulnerabilities
      in various parts of the kernel have been fixed in
      &release.prev;, although too late to be mentioned in the release
      notes.  For more information, see security advisory
