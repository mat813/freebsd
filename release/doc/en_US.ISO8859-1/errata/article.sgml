	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

      Before installing this version, it is important to consult this
      document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
      that may already have been found and fixed.</para>

    <para>Any version of this errata document actually distributed
      with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be
      out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on
      the Internet and should be consulted as the <quote>current
      errata</quote> for this release.  These other copies of the
      errata are located at <ulink
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/"></ulink>, plus any sites
      which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also
      contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of
      the snapshot).</para>

    <para>For a list of all &os; CERT security advisories, see <ulink
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/security/"></ulink> or <ulink

    <para>A buffer overflow in the resolver could be exploited
      by a malicious domain name server or an attacker forging DNS
      messages.  This could potentially be used to force arbitrary
      code to run on a client machine with the privileges of a
      resolver-using application.  See security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-02:28.resolv.asc">FreeBSD-SA-02:28</ulink>

    <title>Late-Breaking News</title>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

    <para>In &os; &release.prev;, the default maximum TCP window size
      was lowered from 65536 bytes to 57334 bytes, for better
      compatability with some versions of
      <application>IPFilter</application>.</para>

    <para>A recently-discovered interaction between the &os; kernel
      and the <filename role="port">archivers/zip</filename> port can
      result in some errors on the alpha platform.  A post-release fix
      has been committed to the &os; ports tree; versions of the
      <filename role="port">archivers/zip</filename> port beginning
      with 2.3_1 will function correctly.</para>

    <para>On the alpha platform, the &man.de.4; and &man.txp.4;
      drivers were moved from the boot kernel on the floppy images to
      modules on the <filename>mfsroot</filename> floppy.  This change
      was made in order to get the alpha kernel to fit onto the boot
      floppy.  It should be transparent to all users, as
      &man.sysinstall.8; will automatically load any kernel modules it
      finds on the <filename>mfsroot</filename> floppy.</para>

    <para>Several last-minute patches were made to the <filename
      role="port">x11-servers/XFree86-4-Server</filename> package.
      These allow the various server configuration programs to give
      better support for the <filename>sysmouse</filename> device
      supported by &man.moused.8;.  The binary packages on the CDROMs
      and the FTP sites incoporate this patch and bear the version
      number 4.2.0_3.  However, the ports collection included in the
      distribution does not contain this patch.  To get an updated
      version, use <application>CVSup</application> to obtain a more
      recent ports collection.</para>

    <para>Some &os;/i386 users have experienced difficulties reading
      from certain ATA CDROM drives.  Specific models on which this
      problem has been observed include the AOpen 48x, 52x, and 56x
      CDROM drives, as well as the Mitsumi Slim CRMC-SR242S CDROM
      drive.  A typical symptom is the following error message on the
      console and/or &man.dmesg.8; buffer (sometimes accompanied by a
      kernel panic):</para>

    <screen>acd0: READ_BIG command timeout - resetting
ata1: resetting devices .. done</screen>

    <para>In some cases, this bug can prevent installation of &os;
      from an affected CDROM drive.  It can cause &man.sysinstall.8;
      to hang while extracting distribution files from CD
      media.</para>

    <para>A two-part workaround listed here has shown to be helpful in
      some (but not necessarily all) cases.  First, to allow a CDROM
      installation, it is necessary to modify the normal CDROM
      installation procedure:</para>

    <procedure>
      <step>
        <para>Start the computer with a &os; installation CDROM in
        the drive.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
        <para>Wait for a console message similar to:</para>

	<screen>Hit [Enter] to boot immediately, or any other key for command prompt.
Booting [kernel] in 9 seconds...</screen>
      </step>

      <step>
        <para>Immediately interrupt the boot process by pressing the
        <keycap>Space</keycap> bar on the keyboard.</para>
      </step>

      <step>
        <para>Enter the following three lines at the
        <literal>ok</literal> prompt:</para>

        <screen><prompt>ok</prompt> <userinput>set hw.ata.ata_dma="1"</userinput></screen>
        <screen><prompt>ok</prompt> <userinput>set hw.ata.atapi_dma="1"</userinput></screen>
        <screen><prompt>ok</prompt> <userinput>boot</userinput></screen>
      </step>

      <step>
        <para>Continue the installation as normal.</para>
      </step>
    </procedure>

    <para>The second part of the workaround takes place after
    completing the CDROM installation (or a successful source
    upgrade).  It consists of configuring the &man.ata.4; driver so
    that future CDROM reads work correctly:

    <procedure>
      <step>
	<para>Add the following two lines to
	  <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> (creating this file
	  if it does not already exist):</para>

	<programlisting>hw.ata.ata_dma="1"
hw.ata.atapi_dma="1"</programlisting>
      </step>

      <step>
        <para>Reboot the machine.
      </step>
    </procedure>

    <para>As of this writing, this issue is under continuing
      investigation.</para>
