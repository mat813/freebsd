	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

    <para>This document lists errata items for &os; &release.bugfix;,
      containing significant information discovered after the release
      or too late in the release cycle to be otherwise included in the
      release documentation.
      This information includes security advisories, as well as news
      relating to the software or documentation that could affect its
      operation or usability.  An up-to-date version of this document
      should always be consulted before installing this version of
      &os;.</para>

    <para>This errata document for &os; &release.bugfix;
      will be maintained until the end-of-life date for the
      &release.branch; branch.  As of the release date, this date was
      estimated to be 31 May 2008.  The current end-of-life state for
      the various &os; branches can be found at <ulink

    <title>Open Issues</title>

    <para>(24 May 2006) The NFSv4 client in &release.bugfix; is an
      unfinished prototype, and there are a number of issues with it
      (many documented in the &os; GNATS database) that make it
      unusable in many situations.  Given the state of
      &release.branch; development, it is unlikely that these will be
      resolved on this development branch.</para>
