<!-- 
	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

    containing significant information

    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This errata document contains <quote>late-breaking news</quote>
    about &os;

    Before installing this version,
    it is important to consult this document to learn about
    any post-release discoveries or 
    problems that may already have been found and
    fixed.</para>

    <para>Any
    version of this
    errata document actually distributed with the
    release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be out of
    date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on the Internet and
    should be consulted as the <quote>current errata</quote> for this
    release.  These other copies of the errata are located at <ulink
    url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/"></ulink>,
    plus any sites which keep up-to-date mirrors of this
    location.</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also
    contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of the
    snapshot).</para>

    <para>For a list of all &os; CERT security advisories, see <ulink
    url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/security/"></ulink> or <ulink
    url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/"></ulink>.</para>

    <title>Security Advisories</title>

<![ %release.type.release [
    <para>No active security advisories.</para>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [
    <para>Support for per-user <filename>~/.login_conf</filename>
    files (as documented in &man.login.conf.5;) has been disabled due
    to incorect merging of local and global settings.  This problem
    will be fixed in future releases.</para>

    <title>System Update Information</title>

    <para>No active updates.</para>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [
    <para>The handling of some types of comments in &man.printcap.5;
      files is faulty.  If a comment line ends in
      <literal>:\</literal> (the characters normally used to indicate
      the continuation of a printer definition), the line following
      the comment will be parsed as a part of the previous printer
      definition.</para>

    <para>One of the release notes refers to the
      <varname>net.inet.tcp.tcp_seq_genscheme</varname> sysctl variable
      for enabling improved compatability in TCP's initial sequence
      number generation algorithm.  This variable was rendered
      unnecessary by the adoption of an algorithm based on RFC 1948,
      which restores proper operation in all cases while maintaining a
      high level of unpredictability in initial sequence numbers.</para>

    <para>The <filename>tools/</filename> directory of a &os; CDROM
      distribution typically contains some DOS programs for i386
      machines, such as <filename>fdimage.exe</filename> and
      <filename>fips.exe</filename>.  This directory was inadvertently
      omitted from the 4.4-RELEASE ISO images generated by the &os;
      Project.  The contents of the <filename>tools/</filename>
      directory are, however, available by anonymous FTP at <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/tools"></ulink> (many
      mirrors also have a copy of this directory).</para>
