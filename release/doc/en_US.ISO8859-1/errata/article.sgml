	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

    <para>This errata document contains <quote>late-breaking news</quote>

      Before installing this version, it is important to consult this
      document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
      that may already have been found and fixed.</para>

    <para>Any version of this errata document actually distributed
      with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be
      out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on
      the Internet and should be consulted as the <quote>current
      errata</quote> for this release.  These other copies of the
      errata are located at <ulink
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/"></ulink>, plus any sites
      which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also
      contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of
      the snapshot).</para>

    <para>For a list of all &os; CERT security advisories, see <ulink

    <title>Security Advisories</title>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

    <para>A race condition existed whereby a file could be removed
    between a &man.fstatfs.2; call and the point where the file is
    accessed, causing a kernel panic.  Only the &man.procfs.5;
    filesystem was known to be vulnerable to this attack.  This bug
    was fixed in &os; &release.prev;, but the security advisory
    describing the bug was issued after the release.  For more
    information, including a workaround and bug fix, see security
    advisory <ulink 
    url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-02:09.fstatfs.asc">FreeBSD-SA-02:09</ulink>.</para>

    <para>Certain SSH
    clients, when attempting to connect to a &os; &release.prev;
    server, will unexpectedly present an
    <application>S/Key</application> prompt, even if &man.sshd.8; on
    the server has not been later explicitly configured for
    <application>S/Key</application> authentication.  This is due to the
    default settings of clients having changed (e.g. use of SSH
    protocol version 2 where it was not used before), or from a change from the client's
    old default authentication sequence.  There are a number of ways
    to disable this behavior:

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
	  <para>On newer <application>OpenSSH</application> clients,
	    add the following line to your 
	    <filename>~/.ssh/config</filename> file:
<programlisting>PreferredAuthentications publickey,password,keyboard-interactive</programlisting>
	  </para>
	</listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>For <application>PuTTY</application> clients, the
	    authentication sequence order cannot be changed, but
	    keyboard-interactive authentication can be disabled in the
	    settings.</para>
	</listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>To disable keyboard-interactive authentication in the
	    server, uncomment the following line
	    in the <filename>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</filename> file
	    (on the server host):
<programlisting>ChallengeResponseAuthentication no</programlisting> 
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>The release notes mentioned the new sbni device driver, but
    gave an incorrect reference to the program in the &os; Ports
    Collection used to configure the driver.  The correct filename for
    the port is <port>sysutils/sbniconfig</port>.</para>

    <para>Linux emulation now requires <literal>options
    SYSVSEM</literal> in the kernel configuration.  This dependency
    was introduced into &os; before &release.prev;.</para>

    <para>Packages containing some optional components of 
      <application>KDE</application> were accidentally omitted from
      the ISO images (and hence the official 4-CD set).  In prior
      releases, these packages could be installed using the
      <port>x11/kde2</port> package.  These components can either be
      installed using the &os; Ports Collection or by downloading the
      binary packages from one of the &os; FTP servers.  The affected
      ports are:
      <port>games/kdegames2</port>, <port>misc/kdeutils2</port>,
      <port>editors/koffice</port>, <port>net/kdenetwork2</port>,
      <port>graphics/kdegraphics2</port>, and
      <port>audio/kdemultimedia2</port>.  Note that the 
      <port>x11/kdelibs2</port> and <port>x11/kdebase2</port>
      packages, which are frequently required by these other
      components, <emphasis>are</emphasis> included on disk 1 of the
      official 4-CD set.
	<footnote>
	  <para>The complete &os; package collection currently fills
	    nine CDROMs.  The official 4-CD set therefore only
	    contains a subset of the available packages.  Several &os;
	    vendors offer distributions that contain a more complete
	    set of packages; a more complete collection can also be
	    found on the &os; FTP sites.</para>
	</footnote>
      </para>

    <para>A binary package containing <application>Samba</application>
      was accidentally omitted from the ISO images.  This software can
      either be installed using the <port>net/samba</port> port in the
      &os; Ports Collection or by downloading and installing its
      binary package from one of the &os; FTP servers.</para>
