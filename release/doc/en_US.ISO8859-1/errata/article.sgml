	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

    <para>[20090501] Some machines do not recognize the i386 disc1 as
      bootable and fall through to booting off the next boot device.
      All affected machines did see the other discs as bootable.  As a
      workaround, you can boot using the bootonly or livefs CDROM and
      then swap in disc1 once &man.sysinstall.8; starts.</para>

    <para>[20090504] A lock handling error has been found in
      interaction between &man.malloc.3; implementation and threading
      library.  When a multi-threaded process calls the &man.fork.2;
      system call in a thread and the &man.malloc.3; function in
      another thread, it can cause a deadlock in the child process.
      An Errata Notice to fix this problem is planned after the
      release.</para>

    <para>[20090505] A bug was found in the &man.bce.4; driver.  This
      prevents it from working with the &man.lagg.4; driver in the
      LACP (IEEE 802.3ad Link Aggregation Control Protocol) mode.  An
      Errata Notice to fix this problem is planned after the
      release.</para>

    <para>[20090507] A bug was found in the &man.fxp.4; driver.  This
      would cause poor TCP performance when TSO is enabled, and the
      receiver has a smaller MSS than the interface MTU setting.  To
      workaround this issue, one can disable TSO by using
      &man.ifconfig.8; <option>-tso</option> parameter (per interface
      basis) or setting <varname>net.inet.tcp.tso</varname> to
      <literal>0</literal> (globally on the system).  An Errata Notice
      to fix this problem is planned after the release.</para>

    <para>[20090504] A patch to solve the locking issue in the
      &man.malloc.3; implementation and threading library has been

      testing.</para>
