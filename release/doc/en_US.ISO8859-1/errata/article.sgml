	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

    <para>This document lists errata items for &os; &release.bugfix;,
      containing significant information discovered after the release
      or too late in the release cycle to be otherwise included in the
      release documentation.
      This information includes security advisories, as well as news
      relating to the software or documentation that could affect its
      operation or usability.  An up-to-date version of this document
      should always be consulted before installing this version of
      &os;.</para>

    <para>This errata document for &os; &release.bugfix;
      will be maintained until the release of &os; &release.bugfix.next;.</para>

    <para>This errata document contains <quote>late-breaking news</quote>
      about &os; &release.bugfix;.
      Before installing this version, it is important to consult this
      document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
      that may already have been found and fixed.</para>

    <para>Any version of this errata document actually distributed
      with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be
      out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on
      the Internet and should be consulted as the <quote>current
      errata</quote> for this release.  These other copies of the
      errata are located at <ulink
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/"></ulink>, plus any sites
      which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also
      contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of
      the snapshot).</para>

    <para>(31 Oct 2004) Sometimes the performance of the &man.re.4; and &man.em.4;
      drivers can become poor under heavy load.  Especially, there are
      reports of &man.em.4; on the IBM ThinkPad T40 locking up
      under such conditions.</para>

    <para>(31 Oct 2004) There are reports of the &man.sk.4; driver
      locking up under heavy load, especially when on-board NICs
      of ASUStek motherboards are used.  To clear the condition,
      bringing the interface down then back up and/or rebooting
      the system are needed.</para>

    <para>(31 Oct 2004) The &man.burncd.8; utility is functional but may behave erratically
      on some systems.  Reported symptoms include that &man.burncd.8;
      can appear to hang up and never complete while the operation actually
      does complete, and the progress indicator does not show the correct value.
      Workarounds include:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Eject and re-insert a media after burning a CD.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Press Ctrl-C when &man.burncd.8; appears to hang up
	  in spite the access LED goes inactive.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>(31 Oct 2004) When the user/group rule modificators in &man.pf.4; and &man.ipfw.4;
      are used, the loader tunable <varname>debug.mpsafenet</varname>
      must be set to <literal>0</literal> (this is <literal>1</literal> by
      default).  For example, the following rules are affected:</para>

    <para>for &man.ipfw.4;:</para>

    <programlisting>count ip from any to 192.168.2.1 uid root</programlisting>

    <para>for &man.pf.4;:</para>

    <programlisting>block log quick proto { tcp, udp } all user root</programlisting>

    <para>To set <varname>debug.mpsafenet</varname> to <literal>0</literal>
      on every boot, add the following line into
      <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>debug.mpsafenet=0</programlisting>

    <para>More specifically, the <literal>group</literal> and <literal>user</literal>
      filter parameters in &man.pf.4;, and the <literal>gid</literal>,
      <literal>jail</literal>, and <literal>uid</literal> rule options
      in &man.ipfw.4; are relevant.
      If <varname>debug.mpsafenet</varname> is set to <literal>1</literal>,
      the system can hang up when the rule is evaluated due to a lock order
      reversal with the socket layer.  More details can be found in the
      &man.ipfw.8; and &man.pf.conf.5; manual pages.</para>

    <para>(31 Oct 2004) The &man.vinum.4; subsystem
      works fine on 5.3, but it can cause a system panic at boot time.
      As a workaround you can add <literal>vinum_load="YES"</literal>
      to <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>.</para>

    <para>As an alternative you can also use the new, &man.geom.4;-based
      &man.vinum.4; subsystem.  To activate the &man.geom.4;-aware
      vinum at boot time, add <literal>geom_vinum_load="YES"</literal>
      to <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>.</para>

    <para>While some sort of uncommon configurations such as
      multiple vinum drives in a disk are not supported,
      it is basically backward compatible.
      Note that for the &man.geom.4;-aware vinum the new userland
      control program, <command>gvinum</command> should be used,
      and it still lacks some functionality.</para>

    <para>(31 Oct 2004) The results of <command>netstat -m</command>
      can become incorrect on SMP systems when <varname>debug.mpsafenet</varname>
      is set to <literal>1</literal> (default).  This is an error
      in the statistics gathering because of a race condition in the
      counters, not an actual memory leak.</para>

    <para>(31 Oct 2004) When installing FreeBSD 5.3 onto a machine
      without PS/2 ports using an USB keyboard, the keyboard will stop
      working once the kernel boots.  As a workaround, select
      <quote>Escape to loader prompt</quote> in the boot loader menu
      and enter the following lines at the prompt:</para>

    <screen>set hint.atkbd.0.flags="0x1"
boot</screen>

    <para>After the installation, add the following line into
      <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>hint.atkbd.0.flags="0x1"</programlisting>

    <para>(1 Nov 2004) The ULE scheduler described in the release note
      has been completely disabled to discourage its use because it has
      several stability problems.</para>

    <para>(1 Nov 2004) Programs linked with <application>libpthread</application>
      may not report any CPU usage statistics according to &man.top.1;,
      while ones linked with <application>libthr</application> have
      the correct statistics.</para>

    <para>(1 Nov 2004) When CMD649 or SiI0680 ATA controller is used,
      the ATA RAID support of &man.ata.4; (ataraid) on 5.3 can corrupt
      the existing RAID configuration which was created on 5.2 or prior.
      The ATA RAID support for these controllers is non-functional
      for this release.</para>

    <para>(3 Nov 2004) For &os;/i386 and &os;/amd64, the SMP support
      in the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel has been disabled
      by default because the SMP kernel can degrade the performance
      on UP machines.  A kernel configuration file <filename>SMP</filename>
      which can be used to enable the SMP support has been added.
      More details on building the custom kernel can be found in
      <ulink url="&url.books.handbook;/kernelconfig.html"></ulink>.</para>
