	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

      Before installing this version, it is important to consult this
      document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
      that may already have been found and fixed.</para>

    <para>Any version of this errata document actually distributed
      with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be
      out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on
      the Internet and should be consulted as the <quote>current
      errata</quote> for this release.  These other copies of the
      errata are located at <ulink
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/"></ulink>, plus any sites
      which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also
      contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of
      the snapshot).</para>

    <para>For a list of all &os; CERT security advisories, see <ulink

    <title>Late-Breaking News</title>

  <para>(20 May 2004) A security problem was discovered
    in <application>CVS</application> but the release notes
    did not state that since it was very late in the release cycle.
    &os; &release.current; includes a fix for it and is not vulnerable.
    For the details, see the security advisory
    <ulink url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-04:10.cvs.asc">FreeBSD-SA-04:10</ulink>.</para>

  <para>(23 May 2004) As a side effect of closing a security problem
    related to &man.msync.2;, the <literal>MS_INVALIDATE</literal>
    flag no longer guarantees that all pages in the range are
    invalidated.  This can cause problems when pages are backed by a remote file
    (e.g. via NFS) where other machines can write to the permanent storage since
    the local pages not being invalidated might then contain stale data.  The
    security problem being addressed is a strictly local exploit, and only
    allows a local user to block the writing of data to a file under certain
    circumstances.  Users who require the old semantics of
    <literal>MS_INVALIDATE</literal> and are not concerned with
    the security issue being fixed can set the
    <literal>vm.old_msync</literal> sysctl to <literal>1</literal>
    which will revert to the old (insecure) behavior.</para>

  <para>(25 May 2004) The &man.twe.4; driver was recently updated by the
    vendor.  Problems have been reported in rare circumstances under
    conditions that are hard to reproduce.  Work is ongoing to isolate
    these problems and determine their source.</para>
