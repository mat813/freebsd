	FreeBSD errata document.  Unlike some of the other RELNOTESng
	files, this file should remain as a single SGML file, so that
	the dollar FreeBSD dollar header has a meaningful modification
	time.  This file is all but useless without a datestamp on it,
	so we'll take some extra care to make sure it has one.

	(If we didn't do this, then the file with the datestamp might
	not be the one that received the last change in the document.)

    <para>This errata document contains <quote>late-breaking news</quote>

      Before installing this version, it is important to consult this
      document to learn about any post-release discoveries or problems
      that may already have been found and fixed.</para>

    <para>Any version of this errata document actually distributed
      with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be
      out of date by definition, but other copies are kept updated on
      the Internet and should be consulted as the <quote>current
      errata</quote> for this release.  These other copies of the
      errata are located at <ulink
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releases/"></ulink>, plus any sites
      which keep up-to-date mirrors of this location.</para>

    <para>Source and binary snapshots of &os; &release.branch; also
      contain up-to-date copies of this document (as of the time of
      the snapshot).</para>

    <para>For a list of all &os; CERT security advisories, see <ulink
      url="http://www.FreeBSD.org/security/"></ulink> or <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/"></ulink>.</para>

    <title>Security Advisories</title>

<![ %release.type.snapshot [

    <para>A buffer overflow in header parsing exists in older versions of
      <application>sendmail</application>.  It could allow a remote
      attacker to create a specially-crafted message that may cause
      &man.sendmail.8; to execute arbitrary code
      with the privileges of the user running it, typically
      <username>root</username>.  More information, including pointers
      to patches, can be found in security advisory <ulink
      url="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/CERT/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-03:07.sendmail.asc">FreeBSD-SA-03:07</ulink>.
      This problem was corrected for &os; &release.prev;
      with a vendor patch and was corrected for &os; &release.current;
      with the import of a new version of
      <application>sendmail</application>.  However, these changes
      may not otherwise have been noted in the release documentation.</para>

    <para>Due to some problems discovered very late in the release
      cycle, the ISO images and FTP install directories for &os;
      &release.prev;/i386 needed to be re-generated and re-uploaded to
      the FTP mirror sites.  For reference, the final ISO images have
      checksums computed via &man.md5.1; as follows:</para>

    <programlisting>MD5 (4.8-RELEASE-i386-disc1.iso) = c4e34b6a6be5cd1977ca206bf821c7fc
MD5 (4.8-RELEASE-i386-disc2.iso) = 93b09f97c01deead302557d7d24f87cb
MD5 (4.8-RELEASE-i386-mini.iso) = 5f0d2576dbb56d6ec85d49ac9fa4bbf9</programlisting>

    <para>Some parts of the documentation may incorrectly give the
      release date of &os; &release.prev; as March 2003, rather than
      April 2003.</para>

    <para>&os; &release.prev; restores the ability to install from the
      installation media to a &man.mly.4; device.  (This capability
      was broken in &os; 4.7-RELEASE.)</para>

    <para>After installing <application>GNOME</application>, the
      default terminal font might be garbled.  If this is the case,
      install the <filename
      role="port">x11-fonts/bitstream-vera</filename> port, then
      restart <application>GNOME</application>.  The new fonts should
      take effect automatically.  If they do not, edit the current
      gnome-terminal profile and select the Bitstream Vera Sans Mono
      font.</para>

    <para>Due to space limitations, the &man.awi.4; driver has been
      removed from the kernel used on the 1.44MB
      <filename>kern.flp</filename> i386 boot floppy.  Because no
      module is available for this driver in &os; &release.prev;, this
      means that it is generally not possible to install &os;
      &release.prev; over an &man.awi.4; network.</para>
      
    <para>Due to space limitations, support for ATAPI floppy disks and
      the DEC AlphaServer 8200 and 8400 (<quote>TurboLaser</quote>)
      machines has been removed from the kernel used on the 1.44MB
      <filename>kern.flp</filename> alpha boot floppy.</para>

    <para>A bug in the &os; &release.prev; kernel prevents it from
      booting on an Intel 80386 processor.  This problem has been
      corrected on both the &release.prev; security fix branch and the
      &release.branch; development branch.</para>

    <para>&os; supports a hashed form of the login capabilities
      database, stored in <filename>/etc/login.conf.db</filename>.
      This is generated from the <filename>/etc/login.conf</filename>
      text file.  If the hashed database is present, &man.login.1;
      will use it in preference to the contents of the text file.
      &os; &release.prev; is the first release that actually includes
      <filename>/etc/login.conf.db</filename> on the distribution
      media; thus, users modifying
      <filename>/etc/login.conf</filename> need to remember to
      regenerate the database, using &man.cap.mkdb.1;.  Users
      performing source upgrades are generally not affected by this
      change, because &man.mergemaster.8; offers the option to
      regenerate <filename>/etc/login.conf.db</filename> during
      upgrades.  &man.login.conf.5; has more details on the format and
      usage of the login capabilities database.</para>
