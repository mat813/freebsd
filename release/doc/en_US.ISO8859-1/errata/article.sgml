      that may already have been found and fixed.</para>

    <para>Any version of this errata document actually distributed
      with the release (for example, on a CDROM distribution) will be

    <para>(18 Nov 2004) A bug in the &man.fetch.1; utility which allows
      a malicious HTTP server to cause arbitrary portions of the client's
      memory to be overwritten, has been fixed.
      For more information, see security advisory

    <title>Open Issues</title>

    <para>(31 Oct 2004) The &man.re.4; and &man.em.4;
      drivers may behave poorly under heavy load.  In particular, there are
      reports of &man.em.4; on the IBM ThinkPad T40 locking up
      under such conditions.</para>

    <para>(31 Oct 2004) There are reports of the &man.sk.4; driver
      locking up under heavy load, especially when ASUStek on-board NICs
      are used.  To clear the condition,
      bringing the interface down then back up and/or rebooting
      the system may be needed.</para>

    <para>(31 Oct 2004) The &man.burncd.8; utility is functional but may behave erratically
      on some systems.  Reported symptoms include that &man.burncd.8;
      can appear to hang and never complete while the operation actually
      does complete, and the progress indicator does not show the correct value.
      Workarounds include:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Eject and re-insert the media after burning a CD.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>Press Ctrl-C when &man.burncd.8; appears to hang up
	  while the access LED goes inactive.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>(31 Oct 2004) When the user/group rule clauses in &man.pf.4; and &man.ipfw.4;
      are used, the loader tunable <varname>debug.mpsafenet</varname>
      must be set to <literal>0</literal> (this is <literal>1</literal> by
      default).  For example, the following rules are affected:</para>

    <para>for &man.ipfw.4;:</para>

    <programlisting>count ip from any to 192.168.2.1 uid root</programlisting>

    <para>for &man.pf.4;:</para>

    <programlisting>block log quick proto { tcp, udp } all user root</programlisting>

    <para>To set <varname>debug.mpsafenet</varname> to <literal>0</literal>
      on every boot, add the following line into
      <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>debug.mpsafenet=0</programlisting>

    <para>More specifically, the <literal>group</literal> and <literal>user</literal>
      filter parameters in &man.pf.4;, and the <literal>gid</literal>,
      <literal>jail</literal>, and <literal>uid</literal> rule options
      in &man.ipfw.4; are affected.
      If <varname>debug.mpsafenet</varname> is set to <literal>1</literal>,
      the system can hang when the rule is evaluated due to a lock order
      reversal with the socket layer.  More details can be found in the
      &man.ipfw.8; and &man.pf.conf.5; manual pages.</para>

    <para>(31 Oct 2004, updated on 12 Nov 2004) The &man.vinum.4; subsystem
      works on 5.3, but it can cause a system panic at boot time.
      As a workaround you can add <literal>vinum_load="YES"</literal>
      to <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>.</para>

    <para>As an alternative you can also use the new &man.geom.4;-based
      &man.vinum.4; subsystem.  To activate the &man.geom.4;-aware
      vinum at boot time, add <literal>geom_vinum_load="YES"</literal>
      to <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename> and remove
      <literal>start_vinum="YES"</literal> in
      <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> if it exists.</para>

    <para>While some uncommon configurations, such as
      multiple vinum drives on a disk, are not supported,
      it is generally backward compatible.
      Note that for the &man.geom.4;-aware vinum, its new userland
      control program, <command>gvinum</command>, should be used,
      and it is not yet feature-complete.</para>

    <para>(31 Oct 2004) The results of <command>netstat -m</command>
      can become incorrect on SMP systems when <varname>debug.mpsafenet</varname>
      is set to <literal>1</literal> (default).  This is an error
      in the statistics gathering because of a race condition in the
      counters, not an actual memory leak.</para>

    <para>(31 Oct 2004, updated on 5 Nov 2004)
      For &os;/i386 and &os;/amd64, when installing &os; 5.3
      using an USB keyboard the keyboard will stop
      working once the kernel boots, because a PS/2 keyboard is
      always considered to be attached.  As a workaround, select
      <quote>Escape to loader prompt</quote> in the boot loader menu
      and enter the following lines at the prompt:</para>

    <screen>set hint.atkbd.0.flags="0x1"
boot</screen>

    <para>Note that if you use the boot floppies, this is set
      by default.</para>

    <para>After the installation, add the following line to
      <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>:</para>

    <programlisting>hint.atkbd.0.flags="0x1"</programlisting>

    <para>(1 Nov 2004) The ULE scheduler described in the release notes
      has been completely disabled to discourage its use because it has
      stability problems.</para>

    <para>(1 Nov 2004) Programs linked with <application>libpthread</application>
      may not report any CPU usage statistics according to &man.top.1;,
      while those linked with <application>libthr</application> show
      the correct statistics.</para>

    <para>(1 Nov 2004) ATA RAID support for the CMD649 and SiI0680 ATA
      controllers is non-functional in this release. When such a
      controller is brough up under &man.ata.4; (ataraid) on 5.3, the
      RAID configuration stored under 5.2 or prior may be corrupted.</para>

    <para>(3 Nov 2004) For &os;/i386 and &os;/amd64, SMP support
      in the <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel has been disabled
      by default because the SMP kernel can degrade the performance
      on UP machines.  A kernel configuration file <filename>SMP</filename>,
      which can be used to enable SMP support, has been added.
      More details on building the custom kernel can be found at
      <ulink url="&url.books.handbook;/kernelconfig.html"></ulink>.</para>

    <para>(4 Nov 2004) The &man.tar.1; utility (also known as &man.bsdtar.1;)
      does not detect the end of media such as tape and
      floppy disk properly when it is specified with the <option>-f</option>
      option.  As an alternative &man.gtar.1; (<application>GNU tar</application>)
      can be used.</para>

    <para>(9 Nov 2004) The &man.geom.4;-aware &man.vinum.4; subsystem
      does not work for RAID5 volumes on machines with a single processor.
      The configurations other than RAID5 (such as RAID1) should work correctly.
      This problem has been fixed on the RELENG_5 branch.</para>

    <para>(9 Nov 2004) The &os; 5.3-RELEASE Migration Guide should have stated
      that <filename>/usr/sbin/nslookup</filename> and
      <filename>/usr/sbin/nsupdate</filename> included in
      <application>BIND 8</application> have to be removed during
      the source-based upgrade procedure.</para>

    <para>(9 Nov 2004) The &os; 5.3-RELEASE Release Notes should have stated
      that <filename role="package">net/mpd</filename> which was compiled
      on the old systems prior to 5.3-RELEASE must be recompiled.</para>

    <para>(10 Nov 2004) The &os; 5.3-RELEASE Release Notes should have stated
      explicitly that ports/packages which were built on the old systems
      prior to 5.3-RELEASE and linked with the old POSIX thread libraries
      (<application>libc_r</application> or <application>libkse</application>)
      can cause an error <quote>Spinlock called when not threaded.</quote>
      at run time.  This happens when the program is linked with multiple
      different threading libraries (typically the older ports will be linked with
      <application>libc_r</application>, while newer ports will be linked with
      <application>libpthread</application>).
      Either recompile the ports/packages or add the necessary lines to
      <filename>/etc/libmap.conf</filename>.
      More details can be found in <filename>/usr/src/UPDATING</filename>
      (20040303 and 20040130).</para>

    <para>(12 Nov 2004) The &man.em.4; driver behaves incorrectly when
      the VLAN support and promiscuous mode are enabled at the same time.
      A fix is being tested and will be merged to the 5.3 errata branch.</para>
